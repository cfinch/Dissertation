\section{Introduction}

The principles of transport and adsorption described in the previous
chapters were applied to the design of microreactors that form the
liquid flow path for a functional \emph{in vitro} model of an alveolus.
Alveoli are micro-scale structures in the lung that facilitate the
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and inhaled
air. Each alveolus is typically $200-250\,\mu m$ in diameter, and
the 300-480 million alveoli in the lungs of an adult human provide
a total surface area of $50-100\, m^{2}$ for gas exchange~\cite{Levitsky2007}.
The alveolar membrane consists of a single layer of epithelial cells
in contact with the air and a single layer of endothelial cells that
forms a capillary for blood flow. Development of an \emph{in vitro}
model of the alveolus-capillary interface would be important to biomedical
science, as this barrier tissue is a point of entry for toxins and
plays a role in compromised gas exchange in disease states. A recent
study found that only 11\% of the drugs that passed preclinical trials
eventually became approved for use by either U.S. or European regulatory
agencies, and that the major causes of drugs failing clinical trials
were lack of efficacy and toxicity \cite{Kola2004}. The majority
of these failures occurred in the expensive late phases of clinical
trials. With the potential to overcome the failures of traditional
cell-based drug assays in predicting physiological behavior, body-on-a-chip
devices have become an increasing area of interest in pharmaceutical
testing \cite{Sung2010}. Body-on-a-chip devices have been created
based on pharmacokinetic models in attempts to supplement traditional
cell culture methods that are not always capable of modeling the tissue-tissue
interactions that can occur when the body is exposed to pharmaceuticals
\cite{Esch2011}. 

Creating an \emph{in vitro} model of the alveolus poses unique challenges
due to the gas-liquid environment, layers of disparate functional
cell types, and the transport of nutrients, cells, and dissolved gas
species through the tissue. One lung-tissue based device was produced
out of poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) to recreate the structure, mechanics,
and certain aspects of transport that occur in lung tissue \cite{Huh2010}.
The elastomeric PDMS material used in the device was highly permeable
to both oxygen and carbon dioxide, which precluded the ability to
create physiologically relevant gas concentrations in the liquid phase
of the environment. Additionally, the high gas diffusion through the
PDMS prevented measurement of gas transport through the tissue, a
fundamental function of the alveolus-capillary interface. To overcome
these limitations silicon microfluidic technology was utilized to
create an \emph{in vitro} body-on-a-chip model of the lung with a
long-term goal of quantifying the rate of gas transport across the
model alveolar membrane. A schematic showing the concept for the design
of the \emph{in vitro} alveolus is shown in Figure \ref{fig:in vitro alveolus}.%

the design of the \emph{in vitro} alveolus. Cells will be cultured

Protein adsorption plays an important role in the microfluidic model
of the alveolus. A PDMS membrane was chosen as the substrate for culturing
monolayers of epithelial and endothelial cells because of its high
permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide. PDMS is regarded as a poor
substrate for cell culture, so it is standard practice to treat the
polymer with an oxygen plasma and adsorb fibronectin onto the membrane
prior to tissue culture~\cite{Powers2010}. Another advantage of
PDMS is that it can be easily molded to create intricate shapes. This
capability will eventually be utilized to create porous membranes
that will allow nutrients, chemical signals and even macrophages to
pass between the air and liquid sides of the membrane.

Upon entering the device, the liquid flows through a conditioning
chamber and exchanges carbon dioxide and oxygen with a conditioning
gas through a PDMS membrane. The conditioning gas is a custom mixture
of carbon dioxide and oxygen that has the same gas composition as
venous blood. The liquid then enters the alveolar chamber with the
same gas composition as venous blood. To be able to detect small changes
in the rate of gas exchange across the model alveolar membrane, the
alveolar chamber was designed such that the gas composition of the
liquid reaches arterial values just before the liquid exits the chamber.
After leaving the alveolar chamber, the liquid passes through another
chamber containing dissolved-gas sensors. These sensors require several
minutes to register small changes in gas levels, so the system was
designed to be operated in either continuous or stop-flow mode. The
microfluidics were designed so that a {}``plug'' of fluid moves
from the alveolar chamber into the sensor chamber with relatively
little mixing in the the longitudinal direction. The residence time
distribution of an ideal plug-flow system is a Dirac delta function,
so the width of the residence time distribution can be used to characterize
how similar a system is to plug flow. Each chamber must be designed
so that liquid flowing through different parts of the chamber experiences
a similar residence time within the chamber. This objective is equivalent
to minimizing the width of the residence time distribution, or approximating
plug flow.

Microreactors have recently been employed for synthetic organic chemistry,
nanoparticle synthesis, and ultra-fast DNA amplification \cite{DeMello2006}.
However, the combination of the no-slip boundary condition and laminar
flow in microfluidic devices produces flow patterns that deviate substantially
from the desired plug flow, presenting a challenge to the design of
continuous-flow microreactors \cite{Hartman2011}. Several innovative
methods have been developed to create plug flow in a microreactor,
such as creating a multiphase flow with dispersed droplets or {}``slugs''
of water containing reagents in a stream of oil \cite{Song2003} or
gas \cite{Guenther2005}. For single-phase flows, a passive microfluidic
structure known as a herringbone mixer can be added to a microfluidic
channel to reduce the width of the residence time distribution to
approximate plug flow \cite{Cantu-Perez2010}. Ideally, combinations
of simulation based design and experimental validation of the results
would be the best approach for successful system development. However,
general methods for minimizing the residence time distribution in
a continuous-flow microreactor by a combination of simulation and
experiment have not been reported. 

In experimental attempts to optimize microfluidic systems, the primary
method employed for visualizing flow patterns in the devices has involved
fluorescent or colored dyes \cite{Carlotto2011,Ryu2011,Campbell2004,Hessel2005}.
Visualization experiments have focused mainly on the mixing of two
components, though this method has been used to a limited extent to
measure residence times in certain devices \cite{Hornung2009}. Both
qualitative visual representations of flow and quantitative measurement
of concentrations can be obtained using dyes, though quantitative
concentration measurements are less common. Theoretical studies have
been performed to predict the residence time distributions of various
types of microfluidic structures. Analytical models have been used
to characterize the hydrodynamic dispersion in microchannels \cite{Dutta2006}.
However, these methods are limited to devices with simple, well-defined
geometries. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations must be
used to simulate practical microfluidic devices with more complex
geometries. Studies have shown that CFD simulations can predict convective
and diffusive transport in microfluidic systems with a high level
of accuracy \cite{Znidarsic-Plazl2007}. Recently, CFD simulations
have been used to predict the residence time distribution of a microfluidic
mixing device by applying a pulse of a {}``tracer'' at the inlet
of the device and monitoring the average concentration at the outlet
\cite{Adeosun2009}. CFD has also been used in conjunction with a
particle tracking simulation to model the residence time distribution
of a microfluidic channel containing a mixing structure \cite{Cantu-Perez2010}.
Although CFD simulations have been used to analyze the residence time
distribution of microfluidic devices, the use of CFD to optimize these
devices has not been widely reported.

The field of microreactor design would benefit from a new methodology
for design optimization that combines experiments and simulations.
This capability would be particularly germane to biomedical engineering
of new systems for drug discovery and toxicology. CFD simulations
were used as part of an iterative design process to quantify the convective
and diffusive transport of dissolved gas in the liquid side of the
alveolus and optimize the design to achieve the best possible approximation
to plug flow. The flexibility of the design process was demonstrated
by the fabrication of an alveolar chamber that could accommodate a
standard tissue culture support and a polygonal chamber for more general
applications. The CFD predictions for different design iterations
were validated with quantitative and qualitative experimental measurements
using dye visualization. The design techniques presented here can
be utilized to optimize the performance of microreactors for any application.


\section{Materials and Methods}


\subsection{Device Fabrication }

Silicon was chosen as the substrate for the microfluidic device due
to its impermeability to gas and the ability to incorporate microstructures
using standard microfabrication techniques, and to allow future incorporation
of other tissue compartments. A planar design was chosen to avoid
drilling or etching through the silicon substrate. Devices were fabricated
using silicon wafers with a thickness of $500\,\mu m$. Wafers were
liquid primed with P20 and spun with Shipley Microposit S1818 photoresist
at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds, followed by a soft bake at $115^{\circ}C$
for 60 seconds on a hotplate. Exposure was performed on an ABM contact
aligner and the photoresist was developed with 726MIF developer. Silicon
wafers were etched with a Unaxis 770 deep reactive ion etcher (DRIE)
to a depth of $125\,\mu m$. The remaining photoresist was stripped,
and the devices were separated with a dicing saw. Devices that incorporated
all three chambers on the same chip as well as isolated chambers for
each component were fabricated and tested. 

Housings were machined from acrylic plates to produce the outside
portions of the microfluidic device. In the bottom section, a rectangular
area was milled to approximately 0.8 mm deep into which a sheet of
PDMS elastomer with nominal thickness of 0.6 mm was placed. The silicon
device was placed on top of the elastomer sheet so that the sheet
pushed the silicon device into the flat surface of the housing top
to produce a tight seal. Inlet and outlet holes were drilled into
the housing top to direct fluid into the inlet of the silicon device
and allow the liquid to escape from the outlet. The two housing pieces
each had a series of threaded screw holes and were held together with
twelve screws. The combined gasket and silicon device thickness was
larger than the depth of the rectangular recess on the bottom housing
piece so that the screws could be tightened to produce a seal between
the top housing piece and the silicon device. 


\subsection{CFD Simulation Methodology}

The CFD-ACE+ suite of simulation tools was used to predict the performance
of the device. The Reynolds and Knudsen numbers were computed to ensure
that flow would be entirely laminar and that the continuum approximations
inherent in CFD would be valid for the system. CFD-GEOM was used to
define the geometry and create a regular mesh throughout the liquid
volume. The velocity derivatives were approximated with upwind differencing
and a 2nd order limiter was used to approximate the derivatives for
computing concentration. A fully implicit first-order (Euler) scheme
was used for time differencing and the time step was calculated automatically
using the {}``Auto Time Step'' feature in CFD-ACE-GUI. The minimum
time step was set to $100\,\mu s$. The actual time step was adjusted
automatically based upon the rate of change of the solution variables,
resulting in a typical maximum time step of $1\, ms$. Simulation
results were saved at regular time intervals. A fixed flow rate boundary
condition was used for the inlet, no-slip boundary conditions were
applied at all walls, and a fixed-pressure boundary condition was
used at the outlet. The system was first simulated in steady-state
with pure water to determine the flow field (it was assumed that dilute
solutions of small molecules would not have a significant impact on
the viscosity of the water.) Transient simulations of gas transport
were then performed, using the flow field from the steady-state simulation
to avoid re-calculating the flow field at each time step.

To characterize the residence time distribution of each design, the
inlet boundary condition introduced water saturated with carbon dioxide
(mass fraction of 0.03366) at a volumetric flow rate of $35\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$,
approximating a step function at the inlet of the device at t=0. Initially,
no gas was present in the water. A wall boundary condition (no gas
transfer) was used for the top wall of the chambers during the residence
time simulations. The results of this simulation protocol should also
be valid for dissolved oxygen, which has a diffusion coefficient similar
to carbon dioxide ($2\times10^{-9}m^{2}s^{-1}$ for oxygen \cite{Jamnongwong2010}
and $1.7\times10^{-9}m^{2}s^{-1}$ for carbon dioxide \cite{Tamimi1994}). 

Transient simulations were also performed to characterize the effectiveness
of gas exchange in the conditioning chamber and alveolar chamber.
The boundary condition at the top of each chamber was set up to model
gas transport across a PDMS membrane. Since oxygen and carbon dioxide
have significantly higher solubility coefficients in PDMS than in
water, the membrane was not expected to present a barrier to gas transport.
Therefore the liquid at the upper boundary was assumed to be in equilibrium
with the gas in the chamber above the membrane. The conditioning chamber
was initially filled with water with no dissolved gas, and degassed
water was introduced at the inlet. At the top of the chamber, the
concentrations of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide were fixed at
the concentrations found in venous blood. For the alveolar chamber,
water with the gas composition of venous blood was introduced at the
inlet, and the initial condition was degassed water. Water at the
top of the chamber was assumed to be in equilibrium with breathing
air. The transient simulations were run until the average gas concentrations
at the outlet reached steady state.

The results were visualized using CFD-VIEW. To quantify the average
concentration across the inlet or outlet channel at a specific point
in time a cut plane was created across the channel and the CFD-VIEW
calculator was used to average the concentration across the plane.
The residence time distribution for the device was calculated by taking
the derivative with respect to time of the normalized concentration
at the outlet. 

Once the device was optimized to minimize the width of the residence
time distribution for dissolved gases in water, another set of simulations
was performed to predict the transport of dye for comparison with
visualization experiments. The diffusion coefficient of Brilliant
Blue FCF dye has not been reported, so it was estimated based on known
diffusion coefficients of similar dye molecules. The molar masses
and diffusion coefficients of Fluorescein ($332\, g\, mol^{-1}$),
Rhodamine 6G ($471\, g\, mol^{-1}$), Congo Red ($697\, g\, mol^{-1}$),
and Trypan Blue ($961\, g\, mol^{-1}$) were plotted on a scatter
plot \cite{Nakagaki1950,Inglesby2001,Culbertson2002}. A roughly linear
relationship was observed between molar mass and diffusion coefficient.
Based on this relationship, the diffusion coefficient of Brilliant
Blue FCF was estimated to be approximately $2\times10^{-10}\, m^{2}s^{-1}$.

design of the alveolar chamber. The diameter of the cell culture membrane

%
\end{figure}
The chamber dimensions and internal structures were optimized by iterative
computational fluid dynamics simulations. The goal was to obtain the
best possible approximation to plug flow so that a bolus of liquid
would flow through the series of chambers with minimal mixing between
the chambers. This goal was equivalent to minimizing the width of
the residence time distribution. A CFD simulation was performed for
each new design and the residence time distribution was calculated
to evaluate that iteration. A round design was chosen for the alveolar
chamber in order to accommodate a circular cell culture membrane,
such as a Transwell insert (Corning Life Sciences). The membrane diameter
was initially specified to be $12\, mm$ but was changed to $6.5\, mm$
mid-way through the design process for reasons unrelated to the design
optimization. Once the shape and diameter of the chamber were established,
transient gas-exchange simulations were performed to establish the
depth of the chambers and the flow rate to ensure that the liquid
exiting each chamber had the desired gas concentration. 

A representative sample of design iterations showing the progress
of the design for the alveolar chamber is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Alveolar chamber designs}.
Initially, posts were added to the entrance of the chamber to support
the gas-exchange membrane and prevent fluid from passing directly
through the middle of the chamber at high velocity (Figure \ref{fig:Alveolus b}).
To prevent the formation of stagnation zones around the outer edges
of the chamber, the posts were changed to short baffles to force liquid
to flow through the stagnation zones (\ref{fig:Alveolus c}). This
was effective for preventing stagnation near the inlet, but had little
effect on stagnation near the outlet. The baffles were then lengthened
to force liquid to flow through the stagnation zones near the outlet
(\ref{fig:Alveolus d},\ref{fig:Alveolus e}). In the final design,
a small gap was added near the end of each baffle to prevent stagnation
on the channel inside of the baffle (\ref{fig:Alveolus f}). 

The concept of the final design of the alveolar chamber can be summarized
as follows. The baffles are circular arcs which divide the incoming
liquid into several streams such that the velocity of the liquid in
each stream is roughly proportional to the length of the path it takes
through the chamber. Liquid following the longest path around the
perimeter of the chamber has the same residence time as liquid traversing
the shortest path through the center of the chamber. The average flow
velocity in each channel is determined by the width of the channel
and the size of the gap between the end of baffle and the center line
of the chamber. The outer baffle is just long enough to prevent a
stagnation zone from forming near the outlet of the chamber. The arc
length of each baffle is as short as possible, since the no-slip boundary
condition on the baffles contributes to axial dispersion within each
channel.

}

\caption{\label{fig:Conditioning chamber designs}Progressive refinement of
the design of the conditioning chamber. Because the device has axial
symmetry, only half of the geometry was simulated.}
%
\end{figure}
The starting point for the design of the conditioning chamber was
a rectangle with tapering inlet and outlet sections, which was based
upon an existing chamber design~\cite{Yuen2001}. This design was
also used for the sensor chamber and for bubble trap chambers which
were included to prevent bubbles from accumulating in the sensor chamber~\cite{Sung2009}.
To allow the device to operate in a stop-flow mode, these chambers
were designed to have the same volume as the alveolar chamber. The
angle of the taper and the chamber width were adjusted to minimize
the width of the residence time distribution while maintaining a volume
equal to that of the circular chamber, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner a}
and \ref{fig:Conditioner b}. A staggered array of posts was then
added to distribute flow throughout the chamber and minimize stagnation
zones (Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner c} through \ref{fig:Conditioner f}.)
The vertical spacing between posts and the number of columns of posts
were adjusted in the CFD model until the flow through the chamber
was as close as possible to plug flow. Because the chamber wall reduced
the velocity of fluid flowing between the top row of posts and the
chamber wall, the spacing between the top row of posts and the chamber
wall had to be larger than the spacing between posts to avoid introducing
a stagnation zone. 


\subsection{Dye Visualization Experiments }

Blue food dye, containing Brilliant Blue FCF (FD\&C Blue 1) dye, was
used for visualizing the flow of liquid through the microfluidic device.
The concentration of dye in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution
used in the experiments was selected based on preliminary data of
light intensity captured by the camera versus dilution of the dye
solution. The solution concentration was chosen to maximize sensitivity
to changes in concentration throughout the range of fully dilute to
non-diluted from the initial concentration. For the initial solution
concentration chosen, the intensity versus concentration profile was
approximately linear, though this relationship would not hold if a
higher concentration of dye was chosen. Visualization experiments
were performed by pumping the dye solution into the devices initially
containing 1X PBS with no dye and visualizing the movement of the
blue dye solution in the chambers. The dye was pumped at a rate of
$35\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$ using a syringe pump. The individual chamber
designs (polygonal chamber and round alveolar chamber) were tested
for dye visualization both with and without posts or baffles to evaluate
the effect of the baffle or post structures on the flow pattern. Additionally,
the alveolar chamber in the final combined device\nobreakdash-incorporating
multiple polygonal chambers and one alveolar chamber\nobreakdash-was
tested to assess the flow pattern in the circular chamber in the practical
device. The flow visualizations in the various devices were used for
comparison to the CFD predictions. 

Dimensional analysis was utilized to understand how the device would
perform with dissolved gas, which has a diffusion coefficient that
is roughly an order of magnitude higher than that of the dye. The
Péclet number is the dimensionless number that represents the ratio
of convective transport to diffusive transport in a fluidic system.
The Péclet number in a channel is given by $Pe=LU/D$, where $L$
is the characteristic dimension of the channel, $U$ is the average
velocity in the channel, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of
the solute. For a rectangular channel, the hydraulic diameter is used
as the characteristic dimension. Using the average velocity in the
channels between the chambers calculated by the CFD simulation, the
Péclet number for dissolved gas with a diffusion coefficient of $2\times10^{-10}\, m^{2}s^{-1}$
was computed to be 770 for a volumetric flow rate of $35\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$.
Because the diffusion coefficient of the dye is one order of magnitude
lower than that of dissolved gas, experiments with dye were performed
with a volumetric flow rate of $3.5\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$ to obtain
a Péclet number comparable to that of dissolved gas. Experiments were
also performed with a flow rate of $350\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$ to characterize
the performance of the system over a range of two orders of magnitude. 


\subsection{Image Analysis }

Images and video of the flowing liquid in the round alveolar chamber
were captured using a Hitachi KP-20a CCD microscope video camera attached
to a Zeiss Stemi DV4 stereo microscope. Because the blue dye absorbs
light primarily in the red region of the visual spectrum, the red
channel of the captured images was isolated and used for image analysis
using ImageJ \cite{Rasband1997-2011}. Video analysis was performed
for flow experiments in which a solution of dye was pumped into the
device. Video was obtained at 5 frames per second from the time dilute
dye could be observed near the inlet of the chamber of interest until
the entire chamber had been filled with dye for several seconds. The
average red channel intensity was measured across a line of pixels
at the inlet of the chamber and at the outlet of the chamber for each
video frame. For each frame, these average intensities for the inlet
and outlet were normalized to four points outside of the chamber unexposed
to dye to account for any variations in overall light intensity. For
both the inlet and outlet, the average red channel intensity of the
first ten frames (corresponding to 0\% saturation) and the last ten
frames (corresponding to 100\% saturation) were computed. The average
concentration across the inlet and outlet for each frame was calculated
by linearly interpolating the average intensity between the 0\% and
100\% saturation intensities found from the beginning and end of the
experiment. The reported concentrations represent the average of three
experiments under the same conditions, with the curves aligned in
time to the points in which the respective inlet concentration reached
15\% saturation.

bubble trap is located downstream (to the right) of the alveolar chamber
to prevent bubbles from accumulating in the sensor chambers, followed
by two chambers that will eventually house dissolved-gas sensors (one
for \BPChem{CO\_2} and one for \BPChem{O\_2}). Four additional chip
designs were fabricated (not shown) to test each chamber design in
isolation: the alveolar chamber with and without baffles and the conditioning
chamber with and without posts.

\section{Discussion}

Figure \ref{fig:Gas exchange simulations} illustrates that the chamber
designs are capable of producing the desired gas exchange characteristics.
Although the steady-state concentration of carbon dioxide at the outlet
of the conditioning chamber does not quite reach the concentration
found in venous blood, this could be easily remedied by slightly changing
the composition of the conditioning gas. The microfluidic alveolar
chamber is more effective than an actual alveolus at oxygenating the
liquid and removing carbon dioxide. The rate of gas exchange across
the membrane is expected to decrease when cells are cultured on the
membrane. The residence time distributions in Figures \ref{fig:RT alveolus}
and \ref{fig:RT Conditioner} indicate that the design optimization
process clearly reduced the width of the residence time distribution
for each chamber, improving the approximation to plug flow. The residence
time distribution of the round chamber without baffles exhibited a
long {}``tail'' which was caused by the stagnation zones that formed
near the outlet of the chamber (Figure \ref{fig:Alveolus no baffles}).
The addition of baffles forced liquid from the inlet to flow around
the outer perimeter of the chamber, greatly reducing these stagnation
zones and suppressing the {}``tail'' of the residence time distribution.
The residence time distribution of the polygonal chamber without posts
was narrower than the residence time distribution of the round chamber
without baffles. Without the constraint imposed by the circular tissue
culture membrane, the shape of the polygonal chamber could be optimized
for plug-like flow without additional structures. However, the addition
of posts further narrowed the residence time distribution. Figure
\ref{fig:RT 3 chambers} demonstrates that each successive chamber
further widens the residence time distribution so that a plug of fluid
becomes more disperse as it progresses through the device. 


\subsection{Dye Visualization Experiments}

The experimental flow patterns confirmed the CFD predictions that
introducing baffles into the alveolar chamber would reduce stagnation
zones to produce a more plug-flow like flow pattern. At early time
points, the baffles prevented a stream of dyed liquid from speeding
toward the outlet along the center line of the chamber, as shown in
time points $3.5\, s$ and $6.5\, s$. Especially at the later time
points, the baffles reduced liquid stagnation near the outer walls
of the chamber. Stagnation zones in the alveolar chamber without baffles
were clearly visible at $11.5\, s$, and stagnant liquid remained
at $16.5\, s$ immediately adjacent to the walls. In contrast, the
liquid near the walls of the alveolar chamber with baffles was much
more uniform in concentration at $11.5\, s$, and the entire chamber
had a nearly uniform concentration at $16.5\, s$. The baffle design
clearly improved the flow patterns in the round alveolar chamber,
though further improvements may be possible. The streaks of higher
and lower concentration liquid, which are prominent at $6.5\, s$,
indicated that the flow pattern on the exit side of the baffles was
not completely uniform. It should be noted that the chambers were
optimized for the transport of gases that have diffusion coefficients
an order of magnitude higher than the diffusion coefficient of the
dye used to visualize the flow patterns. Therefore, the stagnation
zones observed in the dye injection experiments are likely to be much
smaller when dissolved gas is used in place of dye.

The dye visualization of the flow patterns in the isolated conditioning
chamber (Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner CFD Dye}) confirmed that the
post layout improves the uniformity of the flow pattern in the conditioner,
like the baffles improved the flow pattern in the alveolar chamber.
Specifically, at $6.5\, s$ and $9.5\, s$ after the introduction
of dye into the inlet the condition chamber without posts exhibited
large regions of stagnant liquid near the chamber walls, represented
by lighter color. In contrast, the chamber with posts did not experience
these stagnant zones. The CFD simulation predicted that the chamber
without posts should be nearly completely filled with dyed liquid
by $6.5\, s$, while experiments showed that filling the chamber required
somewhat more time. 

In Figure \ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye}, the flow pattern for the
liquid in the alveolus of the full device followed the CFD results
as well as matched the trends of the isolated alveolar chamber with
baffles. The dispersion of dye in the inlet of the alveolus due to
the previous two chambers can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye}.
Because of the non-uniform concentration of dye across the inlet,
the alveolar chamber in the full device requires more time to reach
a uniform concentration compared to the single alveolar chamber. This
trend can also be seen in the images from the CFD simulation. 

The images of the flow patterns (Figures \ref{fig:Alveolus CFD vs Dye}-\ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye})
include information about the distribution of the outlet concentrations
over the width of the chambers. In the chambers without posts or baffles,
there was variation in concentration across the width of the outlet
before full saturation was reached. The liquid near the walls had
a lower concentration of dye than the liquid in the center of the
channel, due to the laminar flow within the chamber and the channels.
In both Figures \ref{fig:Alveolus CFD vs Dye} and \ref{fig:Conditioner CFD Dye},
the posts or baffles greatly reduced this variation across the channel
width, indicating more plug-like flow.

The results from the quantitative evaluation of the outlet profiles
in the isolated alveolar chamber (Figure \ref{fig:Alveolus outlet})
further confirmed the results from the CFD simulation. In both the
CFD and in the experimental visualization, the start of the rise in
concentration of the liquid at the outlet was delayed by the presence
of the baffles. Experimentally, the outlet concentrations reached
saturation at approximately the same time with and without baffles.
The delay in the onset of the increase in outlet concentration coupled
with the fact that the two outlets reached saturation at nearly the
same time indicated that the liquid in the alveolar chamber with baffles
exhibited a narrower distribution of residence times.

The concentration profiles for the conditioning chambers with and
without posts (Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner outlet}) reinforced the
conclusion that the post layout improved the flow patterns to produce
more plug-like flow. The outlet concentrations in both chambers began
to rise at approximately the same time, but the two profiles began
to deviate at approximately the half-saturation point. In this chamber,
the post layout improved the flow pattern by reducing the stagnation
zones, creating a steeper concentration profile at the outlet. Toward
the later times, the outlet concentration profile for the chamber
without posts was delayed by approximately 3 seconds relative to the
profile of the chamber with posts.

The concentration profile at the outlet of the alveolar chamber in
the full device (Figure \ref{fig:3 chambers outlet}) was actually
steeper than the CFD results, indicating a narrower residence time
distribution within the entire chip than was predicted. The inlet
concentration for the alveolus was influenced by the previous two
chambers, so the inlet concentration for the alveolar chamber was
not a step function for either the CFD or the experimental results.
The influence of all three chambers on the flow pattern was incorporated
into both the CFD and experimental results for the three-chamber design.
The fact that the experimental concentration profile at the outlet
of the three-chamber design was only slightly shifted from the isolated
alveolar chamber indicates the entire design was quite effective at
approximating plug flow. 

The full device was imaged and the concentrations at the outlet of
the alveolar chamber were analyzed using flow rates covering three
orders of magnitude to vary the ratio of convective to diffusive mass
transfer (i.e. different Péclet numbers) (Figure \ref{fig:Outlet 3 flow rates}).
As expected, faster flow rates produced less steep concentration profiles
in the normalized time scale, since the higher convective transport
rates limited the amount of diffusion that occurred during the normalized
time period. The slowest flow rate ($3.5\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$) simulates
the outlet concentration profile that would be produced using dissolved
\ce{CO2} (with approximately one order of magnitude higher diffusion
coefficient than dye) at a flow rate of $35\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$, since
the ratio of convective transfer to diffusive transfer is about the
same for both conditions. This condition (\ce{CO2} dissolved in a
liquid flowing at $35\,\mu l\, min^{-1}$) is appropriate for a lung-on-a-chip
device of similar geometry. Thus, the outlet saturation profiles for
different flow rates can be used to estimate the profiles that would
be produced for other diffusion coefficients.

When comparing the original designs to the optimized designs, the
improvements shown by the experimental measurements closely matched
the improvements predicted by the simulations. These results demonstrated
that the CFD-based design process was effective at reducing the number
of experimental iterations required. The slight deviation of the simulation
results from the experimental results was likely due to differences
in the injection of dye at the inlet. The inlet concentration was
modeled as a step function in the CFD simulations. In the experiments,
the concentration at the inlet of the chamber was not a perfect step
function because the dye was injected through a channel in the device
housing which was not included in the CFD model. In the functional
lung device the conditioning chamber will fix the concentration of
dissolved gas in the liquid before it enters the alveolus, so any
dispersion introduced by the channel before the conditioning chamber
will not be significant. 


\subsection{Conclusions}

The microfluidic design presented here is a major step towards a complete
\emph{in vitro} model of the alveolus. A novel design for a round
chamber was developed that minimized stagnation and functioned like
a plug flow reactor despite the inherent disadvantage of the round
shape. This design could be used for any microfluidic chamber that
needs to accommodate a circular cell culture membrane. The design
of the conditioning chamber shows that even better approximations
to plug flow can be achieved if the overall shape of the chamber can
be optimized. The design process, including both iterative CFD simulations
and experimental validation, can be used to optimize the design of
any microreactor. Using CFD to simulate and evaluate design iterations
instead of fabricating a prototype for each iteration greatly reduced
the cost of the project and the time required to achieve the design
goals.
