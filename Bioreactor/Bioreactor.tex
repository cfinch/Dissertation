\chapter{CFD SIMULATION OF TRANSPORT IN A MICROFLUIDIC BIOREACTOR}


\section{Introduction}

Microreactors have recently been employed for synthetic organic chemistry,
nanoparticle synthesis, and ultra-fast DNA amplification \cite{DeMello2006}.
However, the combination of the no-slip boundary condition and laminar
flow in microfluidic devices produces flow patterns that deviate substantially
from the desired plug flow, presenting a challenge to the design of
continuous-flow microreactors \cite{Hartman2011}. The residence time
distribution of an ideal plug-system is a Dirac delta function. Several
innovative methods have been developed to create plug flow in a microreactor,
such as creating a multiphase flow with dispersed droplets or {}``slugs''
of water containing reagents in a stream of oil \cite{Song2003} or
gas \cite{Guenther2005}. For single-phase flows, a passive microfluidic
structure known as a herringbone mixer can be added to a microfluidic
channel to reduce the width of the residence time distribution to
approximate plug flow \cite{Cantu-Perez2010}. Ideally, combinations
of simulation based design and experimental validation of the results
would be the best approach for successful system development. However,
general methods for minimizing the residence time distribution in
a continuous-flow microreactor by a combination of simulation and
experiment has not been reported. 

In experimental attempts to optimize microfluidic systems, the primary
method employed for visualizing flow patterns in the devices has involved
fluorescent or colored dyes \cite{Carlotto2011,Ryu2011,Campbell2004,Hessel2005}.
Visualization experiments have focused mainly on mixing of two components,
though this method has been used to a limited extent to measure residence
times in certain devices \cite{Hornung2009}. Both qualitative visual
representations of flow and quantitative measurement of concentrations
can be obtained using dyes, though quantitative concentration measurements
are less common than qualitative representations. Theoretical studies
have been performed to predict the residence time distributions of
various types of microfluidic structures. Analytical models have been
used to characterize the hydrodynamic dispersion in microchannels
\cite{Dutta2006}. However, these methods are limited to devices with
simple, well-defined geometries. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations must be used to simulate practical microfluidic devices
with more complex geometries. Studies have shown that CFD simulations
can predict convective and diffusive transport in microfluidic systems
with a high level of accuracy \cite{Znidarsic-Plazl2007}. Recently,
CFD simulations have been used to predict the residence time distribution
of a microfluidic mixing device by applying a pulse of a {}``tracer''
at the inlet of the device and monitoring the average concentration
at the outlet \cite{Adeosun2009}. CFD has also been used in conjunction
with a particle tracking simulation to model the residence time distribution
of a microfluidic channel containing a mixing structure \cite{Cantu-Perez2010}.
Although CFD simulations have been used to analyze the residence time
distribution of microfluidic devices, the use of CFD to optimize these
devices has not been widely reported. 

The general field of microreactor design would benefit from new methodology
combining experimental and simulation based tool development, but
this would be particularly germane to biomedical engineering of new
systems for the drug discovery and toxicology fields. A recent study
found that only 11\% of the drugs that passed preclinical trials eventually
became approved for use by either U.S. or European regulatory agencies,
and that the major causes of drugs failing clinical trials were lack
of efficacy and toxicity \cite{Kola2004}. The majority of these failures
occurred in the expensive late phases of clinical trials. With the
potential to overcome the failures of traditional cell-based drug
assays in predicting physiological behavior, body-on-a-chip devices
have become an increasing area of interest in pharmaceutical testing
\cite{Sung2010}. Body-on-a-chip devices have been created based on
pharmacokinetic models in attempts to supplement traditional cell
culture methods that are not always capable of modeling tissue-tissue
interactions that can occur when the body is exposed to pharmaceuticals
\cite{Esch2011}. 

One system of interest is the tissue of the lung, specifically the
small functional alveoli and the alveolus-capillary interface, as
this is the point of entry for toxins through this barrier organ and
compromised gas exchange in disease states. This tissue poses unique
difficulties to the creation of in vitro models due to the gas-liquid
environment, layers of disparate functional cell types, and transport
of nutrients, cells, and dissolved of gas species through the tissue.
One lung-tissue based device was produced out of poly(dimethyl siloxane)
(PDMS) to recreate the structure, mechanics, and certain aspects of
transport that occur in lung tissue \cite{Huh2010}. The elastomeric
PDMS material used in the device was highly permeable to both oxygen
and carbon dioxide, which precluded the ability to create physiologically
relevant gas concentrations in the liquid phase of the environment.
Additionally, the high gas diffusion through the PDMS prevented measurement
of transport of these gas species through the tissue, a fundamental
function of the alveolus-capillary interface in the lung. 

To overcome these limitations silicon based microfluidic technology
was utilized to create an in vitro body-on-a-chip model of the lung
with a long-term goal of quantifying the rate of gas transport across
the model alveolar membrane. To replicate the physiological function
of the alveolus, liquid that enters the model alveolus with a gas
composition similar to the gas composition of venous blood should
exit the chamber with a gas composition similar to that of arterial
blood. To detect small changes in the rate of gas exchange across
the model alveolar membrane, the alveolar chamber should be designed
such that the gas composition of the liquid reaches arterial values
just before the liquid exits the chamber. The chamber must be designed
so that liquid flowing through different parts of the chamber experiences
a similar residence time within the chamber but with the limitation
that gas concentration changes have measurable values. This objective
is equivalent to minimizing the width of the residence time distribution,
or approximating plug flow. This is a necessary first step to enable
dissolved-gas sensors to be incorporated in the device to quantify
the amount of dissolved gas present in the liquid. Since it was determined
that for a microfluidic lung surrogate that these sensors will require
a significant amount of time to reach steady-state, the device was
designed and modeled to operate in a stop-flow mode. CFD simulations
were used as part of an iterative design process to quantify the convective
and diffusive transport of dissolved gas in the liquid side of the
alveolus and achieve the best possible approximation to plug flow.
The flexibility of the design process was demonstrated by the fabrication
of an alveolar chamber that could accommodate a standard tissue culture
support and a polygonal chamber for more general applications. The
modeled results were verified through quantitative and qualitative
experimental measurements using dye visualization of different iterations
of the designed system. The design techniques presented here can be
utilized to optimize the performance of microreactors for any application.


\section{Materials and Methods}


\subsection{Device Fabrication }

Silicon was chosen as the substrate for the microfluidic device due
to its impermeability to gas and the ability to incorporate microstructures
using standard microfabrication techniques, and to allow future incorporation
of other tissue compartments. A planar design was chosen to avoid
drilling or etching through the silicon substrate. Devices were fabricated
using silicon wafers with a thickness of $500\mu m$. Wafers were
liquid primed with P20 and spun with Shipley Microposit S1818 photoresist
at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds, followed by a softbake at $115^{\circ}C$
for 60 seconds on a hotplate. Exposure was performed on an ABM contact
aligner and the photoresist was developed with 726MIF developer. Silicon
wafers were etched with a Unaxis 770 deep reactive ion etcher (DRIE)
to a depth of $125\mu m$. The remaining photoresist was stripped,
and the devices were separated with a dicing saw. Devices that incorporated
all three chambers on the same chip as well as isolated chambers for
each component were fabricated and tested. 

Housings were machined from acrylic plates to produce the outside
portions of the microfluidic device. In the bottom section, a rectangular
area was milled to approximately 0.8 mm deep into which a sheet of
PDMS elastomer with nominal thickness of 0.6 mm was placed. The silicon
device was placed on top of the elastomer sheet so that the sheet
pushed the silicon device into the flat surface of the housing top
to produce a tight seal. Inlet and outlet holes were drilled into
the housing top to direct fluid into the inlet of the silicon device
and allow the liquid to escape from the outlet. The two housing pieces
each had a series of threaded screw holes and were held together with
twelve screws. The combined gasket and silicon device thickness was
larger than the depth of the rectangular recess on the bottom housing
piece so that the screws could be tightened to produce a seal between
the top housing piece and the silicon device. 


\subsection{CFD Simulation Methodology}

The CFD-ACE+ suite of simulation tools was used to predict the performance
of the device. CFD-GEOM was used to define the geometry and create
a regular mesh throughout the liquid volume. The velocity derivatives
were approximated with upwind differencing and a 2nd order limiter
was used to approximate the derivatives for computing concentration.
The system was simulated in steady-state with pure water to determine
the flow field (it was assumed that dilute solutions of small molecules
would not have a significant impact on the viscosity of the water.)
A transient simulation of gas transport was then performed, using
the flow field from the steady-state simulation to avoid re-calculating
the flow field at each time step. Initially, no dissolved gas was
present in the water. To characterize the residence time distribution
of each design, the inlet boundary condition introduced water saturated
with carbon dioxide (mass fraction of 0.03366) at a volumetric flow
rate of $35\mu l\, min^{-1}$, approximating a step function at the
inlet of the device at t=0. The results of this simulation protocol
should also be valid for dissolved oxygen, which has a diffusion coefficient
similar to carbon dioxide ( for oxygen \cite{Jamnongwong2010} and
for carbon dioxide \cite{Tamimi1994}). The Euler method was used
for time stepping, and the time step was calculated automatically
using the Auto Time Step feature in CFD-ACE-GUI. The minimum time
step was set to $100\mu s$. The time step was automatically adjusted
based upon the rate of change of solution variables. The typical maximum
time step was 1 ms, and the simulation results were saved at regular
time intervals. The results were visualized using CFD-VIEW. To quantify
the average concentration across the inlet or outlet channel at a
specific point in time a cut plane was created across the channel
and the CFD-VIEW calculator was used to average the concentration
across the plane. The residence time distribution for the device was
calculated by taking the derivative with respect to time of the normalized
concentration at the outlet. 

Once the device was optimized to minimize the width of the residence
time distribution for dissolved gases in water, another set of simulations
was performed to predict the transport of dye for comparison with
visualization experiments. The diffusion coefficient of Brilliant
Blue FCF dye has not been reported, so it was estimated based on known
diffusion coefficients of similar dye molecules. The molar masses
and diffusion coefficients of Fluorescein ($332g\, mol^{-1}$), Rhodamine
6G ($471g\, mol^{-1}$), Congo Red ($697g\, mol^{-1}$), and Trypan
Blue ($961g\, mol^{-1}$) were plotted on a scatter plot \cite{Nakagaki1950,Inglesby2001,Culbertson2002}.
A roughly linear relationship was observed between molar mass and
diffusion coefficient. Based on this relationship, the diffusion coefficient
of Brilliant Blue FCF was estimated to be approximately .


\subsection{Dye Visualization Experiments }

Blue food dye, containing Brilliant Blue FCF (FD\&C Blue 1) dye, was
used for visualizing the flow of liquid through the microfluidic device.
The concentration of dye in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution
used in the experiments was selected based on preliminary data of
light intensity captured by the camera versus dilution of the dye
solution. The solution concentration was chosen to maximize sensitivity
to changes in concentration throughout the range of fully dilute to
non-diluted from the initial concentration. For the initial solution
concentration chosen, the intensity versus concentration profile was
approximately linear, though this relationship would not hold if a
higher concentration of dye was chosen. Visualization experiments
were performed by pumping the dye solution into the devices initially
containing 1X PBS with no dye and visualizing the movement of the
blue dye solution in the chambers. The dye was pumped at a rate of
$35\mu l\, min^{-1}$ using a syringe pump. The individual chamber
designs (polygonal chamber and round alveolar chamber) were tested
for dye visualization both with and without posts or baffles to evaluate
the effect of the simulation-driven baffle or post structures on the
flow pattern. Additionally, the alveolar chamber in the final combined
device\nobreakdash-incorporating two polygonal chambers and one alveolar
chamber\nobreakdash-was tested to assess the flow pattern in the
circular chamber in the practical device. The flow patterns in the
various devices were also used for comparison to the CFD predictions. 

Dimensional analysis was utilized to understand how the device would
perform with dissolved gas, which has a diffusion coefficient that
is roughly an order of magnitude higher than that of the dye. The
Péclet number is the dimensionless number that represents the ratio
of convective transport to diffusive transport in a fluidic system.
The Péclet number in a channel is given by , where L is the characteristic
dimension of the channel, U is the average velocity in the channel,
and D is the diffusion coefficient of the solute. For a rectangular
channel, the hydraulic diameter is used as the characteristic dimension.
Using the average velocity in the channels between the chambers calculated
by the CFD simulation, the Péclet number for dissolved gas with a
diffusion coefficient of was computed to be 770 for a volumetric flow
rate of $35\mu l\, min^{-1}$. To obtain a similar Péclet number with
the dye (D= ), experiments were performed with a volumetric flow rate
of $3.5\mu l\, min^{-1}$. Experiments were also performed with a
flow rate of $350\mu l\, min^{-1}$ to establish a two order of magnitude
range of performance with the system. 


\subsection{Image Analysis }

Images and video of the flowing liquid in the round alveolar chamber
were captured using a Hitachi KP-20a CCD microscope video camera attached
to a Zeiss Stemi DV4 stereo microscope. Because the blue dye absorbs
light primarily in the red region of the visual spectrum, the red
channel of the captured images was isolated and used for image analysis
using ImageJ \cite{Rasband1997-2011}. Video analysis was performed
for flow experiments in which a solution of dye was pumped into the
device. Video was obtained at 5 frames per second from the time dilute
dye could be observed near the inlet of the chamber of interest until
the entire chamber had been filled with dye for several seconds. The
average red channel intensity was measured across a line of pixels
at the inlet of the chamber and at the outlet of the chamber for each
video frame. For each frame, these average intensities for the inlet
and outlet were normalized to four points outside of the chamber unexposed
to dye to account for any variations in overall light intensity. For
both the inlet and outlet, the average red channel intensity of the
first ten frames (corresponding to 0\% saturation) and the last ten
frames (corresponding to 100\% saturation) were computed. The average
concentration across the inlet and outlet for each frame was calculated
by linearly interpolating the average intensity between the 0\% and
100\% saturation intensities found from the beginning and end of the
experiment. The reported concentrations represent the average of three
experiments under the same conditions, with the curves aligned in
time to the points in which the respective inlet concentration reached
15\% saturation.

\end{figure}
The design goal was to obtain the best possible approximation to plug
flow so that a bolus of liquid would flow from one chamber into the
next with minimal mixing between the chambers. The overall layout
of the device is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Microreactor}a. The microfluidic
device fabricated in silicon is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Microreactor}b.
The silicon device in the acrylic housing is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Microreactor}c.
The first chamber after the inlet is a bubble trap \cite{Sung2009},
followed by a chamber that will eventually be used to condition the
liquid to contain physiologically relevant concentrations of dissolved
gas. The alveolar chamber was designed to be round so that a variety
of membranes could be used for tissue culture in the future, including
commercially available membrane supports such as Transwell inserts
(Corning Life Sciences). Two sensor chambers were included downstream
of the alveolar chamber to allow incorporation of dissolved gas sensors.
Another bubble trap was incorporated between the alveolus and the
sensor chambers to prevent bubbles from accumulating in the sensor
chambers. To allow the device to operate in a stop-flow mode, all
the chambers were designed to have the same volume.

%
\end{figure}
After the general layout was established as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:Microreactor},
the chamber dimensions and internal structures were optimized by successive
computational fluid dynamics modeling of the system. The iterative
design process revolved around minimizing the width of the residence
time distribution. A CFD simulation was performed for each new design
iteration and the residence time distribution was calculated to evaluate
that iteration. The alveolar chamber was designed to accommodate a
circular cell culture membrane with a diameter of 6.5mm. Baffles in
the shape of circular arcs were added to the chamber to support the
membrane and reduce the width of the residence time distribution.
The baffles divide the incoming liquid into several streams such that
the velocity of the liquid in each stream is roughly proportional
to the length of the path it takes through the chamber. Specifically,
the baffles were designed so that liquid following the longest path
around the perimeter of the chamber would have the same residence
time as liquid that traversed the shortest path through the center
of the chamber. The arc length of each baffle was kept as short as
possible, since the no-slip boundary condition on the baffles contributed
to axial dispersion within each channel. The outer baffle was designed
to be long enough to prevent a stagnation zone from forming near the
outlet of the chamber. The inner baffles were made progressively shorter.
A small gap was added near the end of each baffle to prevent stagnation
on the channel inside of the baffle. The flow pattern inside an isolated
alveolar chamber with and without baffles is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Alveolus CFD vs Dye},
including both CFD results and experimental visualization.

%
\end{figure}
The chamber design for the bubble trap and conditioning chamber were
chosen to be rectangles with tapering inlet and outlet sections. The
angle of the taper and the chamber width were adjusted to minimize
the width of the residence time distribution while maintaining a volume
equal to that of the circular chamber. A staggered array of posts
was then created in each chamber to modify the flow characteristics.
The vertical spacing between posts and the number of columns of posts
were adjusted in the CFD model until the flow through the chamber
was as close as possible to plug flow. Because the chamber wall reduced
the velocity of fluid flowing between the top row of posts and the
chamber wall, the spacing between the top row of posts and the chamber
wall had to be larger than the spacing between posts to avoid introducing
a stagnation zone. Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner CFD Dye} indicates
the amount of dye present in different locations within the isolated
conditioning chamber and bubble trap at various times. The flow patterns
for the conditioning chambers with and without the post arrangement
are shown along with the flow patterns expected from the CFD results.
The visual scale of the CFD results was normalized so that pure water
was represented as white and the maximum dye concentration was black.

the isolated alveolar chamber and CFD results in Figure \ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye}.

\section{Discussion}

The residence time distributions in Figures \ref{fig:RT alveolus}
and \ref{fig:RT Conditioner} indicate that the design optimization
process clearly reduced the width of the residence time distribution
for each chamber, improving the approximation to plug flow. The residence
time distribution of the round chamber without baffles exhibited a
long {}``tail'' which was caused by the stagnation zones that formed
near the outlet of the chamber (Figure \ref{fig:Alveolus no baffles}).
The addition of baffles forced liquid from the inlet to flow around
the outer perimeter of the chamber, greatly reducing these stagnation
zones and suppressing the {}``tail'' of the residence time distribution.
The residence time distribution of the polygonal chamber without posts
was narrower than the residence time distribution of the round chamber
without baffles. Without the constraint imposed by the circular tissue
culture membrane, the shape of the polygonal chamber could be optimized
for plug-like flow without additional structures. However, the addition
of posts further narrowed the residence time distribution. Figure
\ref{fig:RT 3 chambers} demonstrates that each successive chamber
further widens the residence time distribution so that a plug of fluid
becomes more disperse as it progresses through the device. 


\subsection{Dye Visualization Experiments}

The experimental flow patterns confirmed the CFD results that introducing
baffles into the alveolar chamber reduced stagnation zones to produce
a more plug-flow like flow pattern. At early time points, the baffles
prevented a stream of dyed liquid in the center from speeding toward
the outlet, as shown in time points 3.5s and 6.5s. Especially at the
later time points, the baffles reduced liquid stagnation near the
outer walls of the chamber. Stagnation zones in the alveolar chamber
without baffles were clearly visible at 11.5s, and stagnant liquid
remained at 16.5s immediately adjacent to the walls. In contrast,
the liquid near the walls of the alveolar chamber with baffles was
much more uniform in concentration at 11.5s, and the entire chamber
had a nearly uniform concentration at 16.5s. 

The baffle design clearly improved the flow patterns in the round
alveolar chamber, though further improvements may be possible. The
streaks of higher and lower concentration liquid, which are prominent
at 6.5s, indicated that the flow pattern on the exit side of the baffles
was not completely uniform. It should be noted that the chambers were
optimized for the transport of gases that have diffusion coefficients
an order of magnitude higher than the diffusion coefficient of the
dye used to visualize the flow patterns. Therefore, the stagnation
zones observed in the dye injection experiments are likely to be much
smaller when dissolved gas is used in place of dye.

The dye visualization of the flow patterns in the conditioning chamber
(Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner CFD Dye}) confirmed that the post layout
improves the uniformity of the flow pattern in the conditioner, like
the baffles improved the flow pattern in the alveolar chamber. Specifically
at 6.5s and 9.5s after the introduction of dye into the inlet, the
condition chamber without posts exhibited large regions of stagnant
liquid near the chamber walls, represented by lighter color. In contrast,
the chamber with posts did not experience these stagnant zones. The
CFD simulation predicted that the chamber without posts should be
nearly completely filled with dyed liquid by 6.5s, while experiments
showed that fillitheng the chamber required somewhat more time. In
Figure \ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye}, the flow pattern for the liquid
in the alveolus of the three chamber device followed the CFD results
as well as matched the trends of the isolated alveolar chamber with
baffles. The dispersion of dye in the inlet of the alveolus due to
the previous two chambers can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye}.
Because of the dispersion at the inlet, the alveolar chamber in the
three-chamber device requires more time to reach a uniform concentration
compared to the single alveolar chamber. This trend can also be seen
in the images from the CFD simulation. 

The images of the flow patterns (Figures \ref{fig:Alveolus CFD vs Dye}-\ref{fig:3 Chambers CFD Dye})
include information about the distribution of the outlet concentrations
over the width of the chambers. In the chambers without posts or baffles,
there was variation in concentration across the width of the outlet
before full saturation was reached. The liquid near the walls had
a lower concentration of dye than the liquid in the center of the
channel, due to the laminar flow within the chamber and the channels.
In both Figures \ref{fig:Alveolus CFD vs Dye} and \ref{fig:Conditioner CFD Dye},
the posts or baffles greatly reduced this variation across the channel
width, indicating more plug-like flow. The baffles and posts effectively
reduced the variation in times the liquid took to reach the outlet. 

The results from the quantitative evaluation of the outlet profiles
in the isolated alveolar chamber (Figure \ref{fig:Alveolus outlet})
further confirmed the results from the CFD simulation. In both the
CFD and in the experimental visualization, the start of the rise in
concentration of the liquid at the outlet was delayed by the presence
of the baffles. Experimentally, the outlet concentrations reached
saturation at approximately the same time with and without baffles.
The delay in the onset of the increase in outlet concentration coupled
with the fact that the two outlets reach saturation at nearly the
same points indicated that the liquid in the alveolar chamber with
baffles exhibited a narrower distribution of residence times.

The concentration profiles for the conditioning chambers with and
without posts (Figure \ref{fig:Conditioner outlet}) reinforced the
conclusion that the post layout improved the flow patterns to produce
more plug-like flow. The outlet concentrations in both chambers began
to rise at approximately the same time, but the two profiles began
to deviate at approximately the half-saturation point. In this chamber,
the post layout improved the flow pattern by reducing the stagnation
zones, creating a steeper concentration profile at the outlet. Toward
the later times, the outlet concentration profile for the chamber
without posts was delayed by approximately 3 seconds relative to the
profile of the chamber with posts. 

The concentration profile for the three chamber device (Figure \ref{fig:3 chambers outlet})
in this case was actually steeper than the CFD results, indicating
a narrower residence time distribution within the entire chip than
was predicted. The inlet concentration for the alveolus was probably
influenced by the previous two chambers, so the inlet concentration
for the alveolar chamber was not a step function for either the CFD
or the experimental results. The influence of all three chambers on
the flow pattern was incorporated into both the CFD and experimental
results for the three-chamber design. The fact that the experimental
concentration profile at the outlet of the three-chamber design was
only slightly shifted from the isolated alveolar chamber indicates
the entire design was quite effective at approximating plug flow. 

The three chamber device was imaged and the outlet concentrations
analyzed using three different orders of magnitude for the flow rate
to produce flows of varying ratios of convective flow to diffusive
transfer (i.e. different Péclet numbers) (Figure \ref{fig:Outlet 3 flow rates}).
As expected, faster flow rates produced less steep concentration profiles
in the normalized time scale, since the higher convective transport
rates limited the amount of diffusion that occurred during the normalized
time period. The slowest flow rate ($3.5\mu l\, min^{-1}$) simulates
the outlet concentration profile that would be produced using dissolved
$\textrm{C\ensuremath{O_{2}}}$ (with approximately one order of magnitude
higher diffusion coefficient than dye) at a flow rate of $35\mu l\, min^{-1}$,
since the ratio of convective transfer to diffusive transfer is about
the same for both conditions. This condition ($\textrm{C\ensuremath{O_{2}}}$
dissolved in a liquid flowing at $35\mu l\, min^{-1}$) is appropriate
for a lung-on-a-chip device of similar geometry. Thus, the different
flow rate outlet profiles can be used to estimate the profiles that
would be produced for other diffusion coefficients. 

When comparing the original designs to the optimized designs, the
improvements shown by the experimental measurements closely matched
the improvements predicted by the simulations. These results demonstrated
that the CFD-based design process was effective at reducing the number
of experimental iterations required. The slight deviation of the simulation
results from the experimental results was likely due to differences
in inlet concentration profiles. The inlet concentration was modeled
as a step function in the CFD simulations. In the experiments, the
concentration at the inlet of the chamber was not a perfect step function.
The dye was injected through a channel in the device housing which
was not included in the CFD model. In the functional lung device the
