\begin_layout Plain Layout

Mass transport limitations and surface interactions are important phenomena
 in microfluidic devices.
 The flow of water is laminar at small scales, and the absence of turbulent
 mixing can lead to transport limitations.
 Microscale devices have a high ratio of surface area to volume, and proteins
 are known to adsorb preferentially at interfaces.
 Protein adsorption plays a significant role in biology by mediating critical
 processes such as the attachment of cells to surfaces, the immune response
 and the coagulation of blood.
 Simulation tools that can quantitatively predict transport and protein
 adsorption will enable the rational design of microfluidic devices for
 biomedical applications.

Two-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) models are widely used
 to model the adsorption of proteins on surfaces.
 As Brownian dynamics simulations have become popular for modeling protein
 adsorption, the interface model has changed from two-dimensional to three-dimen
sional.
 Brownian dynamics simulations were used to model the diffusive transport
 of hard-sphere particles in a liquid and the adsorption of the particles
 onto a uniform surface.
 The configuration of the adsorbed particles was analyzed to quantify the
 chemical potential near the surface, which was used to derive a continuum
 model of adsorption that incorporates the results from the Brownian dynamics
 simulations.
 The equations of the continuum model were discretized and coupled to a
 conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of diffusive
 transport to the surface.
  The kinetics of adsorption predicted by the continuum model closely matched
 the results from the Brownian dynamics simulation.
  This new model allows the results from mesoscale simulations to be used
 as a boundary condition for micro- or macro-scale CFD simulations of transport
 and protein adsorption in practical devices.

Kinetic models were used to interpret experimental measurements of the kinetics
 of protein adsorption.
 A Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) biosensor was constructed and used to measure
 the adsorption of fibronectin (FN) and glucose oxidase (GO) onto several
 types alkysilane self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).
 Computational fluid dynamics was used to model the transport of protein
 in the flow cell of the biosensor and the results were used to improve
 the accuracy of the kinetic models.
 Multiple kinetic models were fitted to the experimental data.
  The fitted parameter values and the quality of fit of the various models
 were analyzed to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of adsorption.
 Cells were cultured on silane surfaces coated with FN to assess its biological
 activity, and a colorimetric assay was used to determine the enzymatic
 activity of the adsorbed glucose oxidase.
 The results of the GO activity assay were compared to the activity predicted
 by the models.
 The WGM biosensor, transport simulation and kinetic model fitting enabled
 new insights into the adsorption of proteins on functionalized surfaces
 at solution concentrations that were previously unattainable.

The process of CFD simulation and experimental validation was used to design
 a microfluidic bioreactor that mimics the function of an alveolus.
 The design goal was to move a ``plug'' of liquid from the alveolus to a
 sensor chamber.
 Microreactors experience significant deviations from plug flow due to the
 high ratio of surface area to volume and the no-slip boundary condition
 at the walls of the chamber.
  Iterative CFD simulations were performed to optimize microfluidic structures
 to minimize the width of the residence time distributions of two types
 of chambers.
 Qualitative and quantitative visualization experiments with a dye indicator
 demonstrated that the CFD simulations accurately predicted the residence
 time distributions of the chambers.
  The results show that the combination of simulations and experiments can
 be used to optimize the performance of microreactors for
