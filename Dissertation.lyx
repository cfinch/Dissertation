\begin_layout Plain Layout

A Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) biosensor was constructed to measure the
 adsorption of protein onto alkysilane self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
 at solution concentrations unattainable with other techniques.
 The high sensitivity was provided by a WGM resonance excited in a silica
 microsphere that was functionalized with alkylsilane SAMs and integrated
 in a microfluidic flow cell under laminar flow conditions.
 It was found that FN adsorbed at biologically relevant surface densities,
 however, the adsorption kinetics and concentration dependent saturation
 values varied significantly from work published utilizing alkanethiol SAMs.
  Mathematical models were applied to the experimental results to interpret
 the observed kinetics of FN adsorption.
 Embryonic hippocampal neurons and skeletal myoblasts were cultured on the
 modified surfaces, and a live-dead assay was used to determine the viability
 of the FN surfaces for cell culture, and major differences were noted in
 the biological response to the different SAMs.
  The high sensitivity and simplicity of the WGM biosensor, combined with
 its ability to quantify the adsorption of any dilute protein in a label-free
 assay, establishes the importance of this technology for the study of surface
 accretion and its effect on cellular function, which can affect biomaterials
 for both in vivo and in vitro applications.

Two-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) models are widely used
 to model the adsorption of proteins on solid surfaces.
  Continuum equations have been developed so that the results of RSA simulations
 can be used to predict the kinetics of adsorption.
  Recently, Brownian dynamics simulations have become popular for modeling
 protein adsorption.
 A continuum model was developed to allow the results from a Brownian dynamics
 simulation to be used as a boundary condition in a computational fluid
 dynamics (CFD) simulation.
  A Brownian dynamics simulation was used to model the diffusive transport
 of hard-sphere particles in a liquid, and the adsorption of the particles
 onto a solid surface.
  The configuration of the adsorbed particles was analyzed, using a Monte
 Carlo method and computational geometry, to quantify the chemical potential
 of a test particle in solution near the surface.
  The chemical potential was found to be a function of the distance between
 the test particle and the surface, and the surface coverage.
  The near-surface chemical potential was used to derive a continuum model
 of adsorption that incorporates the results from the Brownian dynamics
 simulation.
  The equations of the continuum model were discretized and coupled to a
 CFD simulation of diffusive transport to the surface.
  The kinetics of adsorption predicted by the continuum model was very close
 to the results from the Brownian dynamics simulation.
  This model allows the results from mesoscale simulations to be incorporated
 into micro- or macro-scale CFD transport simulations of protein adsorption
 in practical devices.

Microreactors experience significant deviations from plug flow due to the
 no-slip boundary condition at the walls of the chamber.
  The development of stagnation zones leads to widening of the residence
 time distribution at the outlet of the reactor.
  A hybrid design optimization process that combines modeling and experiments
 has been developed utilized to minimize the width of the residence time
 distribution in a microreactor.
  The process was used to optimize the design of a microfluidic system for
 an in vitro model of the lung alveolus.
  Iterative computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed
 to optimize the microfluidic structures for two different types of chambers.
   The residence time distributions of the optimized chambers were significantly
 narrower than those of non-optimized chambers, indicating that the optimized
 final chambers better approximate plug flow.
  Qualitative and quantitative visualization experiments with food dye indicator
s indicated demonstrated that the CFD results accurately predicted the residence
 time distributions within the bioreactors.
  The results demonstrate that the such a hybrid optimization process can
 be used to design microreactors that approximate plug flow for in vitro
 tissue engineered systems.
   This technique can be applied to optimize optimization of  the performance
 of the compartments in microfluidic body-on-a-chip systems for drug and
 toxin studies.
