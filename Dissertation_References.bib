	Abstract = {Biosensors based on the shift of whispering-gallery modes in microspheres
	accompanying protein adsorption are described by use of a perturbation
	theory. For random spatial adsorption, theory predicts that the shift
	should be inversely proportional to microsphere radius R and proportional
	to protein surface density and excess polarizability. Measurements
	are found to be consistent with the theory, and the correspondence
	enables the average surface area occupied by a single protein to
	be estimated. These results are consistent with crystallographic
	data for bovine serum albumin. The theoretical shift for adsorption
	of a single protein is found to be extremely sensitive to the target
	region, with adsorption in the most sensitive region varying as 1/R5/2
	. Specific parameters for single protein or virus particle detection
	are predicted.},

@article{Brewer1999,
	Abstract = {Adult mammalian CNS neurons appear to be terminally differentiated
	and postmitotic. However, this conclusion may be due to nonpermissive
	conditions in the brain or in culture media. If embryonic rat hippocampal
	neurons are cultured in Neurobasal/B27 with FGF2, nearly all neurons
	proliferated until a maximum density was reached. Similarly, adult
	neurons can be cultured that fire action potentials and display immunoreactivity
	for neurofilament, MAP2, tau, and glutamate. Seventy percent of the
	3000 isolated adult cells per milligram of brain tissue began to
	proliferate after 3 days in culture and incorporated BrdU. By 4 days
	of regeneration in culture, virtually all neuron-like cells with
	asymmetric processes were glutamate positive and immunoreactive for
	neurofilament. Immunoreactivity of the intermediate filament stem
	cell marker nestin increased in adult cells to levels present in
	freshly isolated embryonic neurons. These are the first studies to
	demonstrate that over 50% of adult CNS cells with neuron-like characteristics
	retain regenerative and proliferative potential.},

@article{Brewer1995,
	Abstract = {Two fundamental questions about neuron cell culture were addressed.
	Can one serum-free medium that was developed for optimum growth of
	hippocampal neurons support the growth of neurons from other regions
	of the brain? Is the region specific state of differentiation maintained
	in culture? To answer these questions, we isolated neurons from six
	other rat brain regions, placed them in culture in B27/NeurobasalTM
	defined medium, and analyzed their morphology and growth dependence
	on cell density after 4 days in culture. Neuronal identity was confirmed
	by immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament 200. Neurons from
	each brain region maintained distinctive morphologies in culture
	in the virtual absence of glia. Cells isolated from embryonic day
	18 cerebral cortex by digestion with papain showed the same high
	survival as hippocampal neurons, e.g., 70% survival for cells plated
	at 160/mm2. At this age and density, neurons from the septum showed
	slightly lower survival, 45%. Survival of dentate granule neurons
	from postnatal day four brains was 30-40%, significantly lower, and
	relatively independent of plating density. This suggests an absence
	of dependence on trophic factors or contact for dentate granule neurons.
	Growth of cerebellar granule neurons isolated from postnatal day
	7, 8, or 9 brains in B27/Neurobasal was compared to growth in BME/10%
	serum. Viability in serum-free medium at 4 days was much better than
	that in serum, did not require KCI elevated to 25 mM, and occurred
	without substantial growth of glia. Cerebellar granule neurons plated
	at 1,280 cells/mm2 were maintained in culture for three weeks with
	17 of the original cell density surviving. Survival of cells isolated
	from embryonic day 18 substantia nigra was 50% at 160 cells/mm2 after
	4 days, similar to that of striatum, but slightly less than hippocampal
	neuron survival. The dopaminergic phenotype of the substantia nigral
	neurons was maintained over 2 weeks in culture as judged by immunoreactivity
	with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase. During this time, immunoreactivity
	was found in the processes as they grew out from the soma. Together,
	these studies suggest that B27/Neurobasal will be a useful medium
	for maintaining the differentiated growth of neurons from many brain
	regions. Potential applications of a common growth medium for different
	neurons are discussed. {\copyright} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Brewer1993,
	Abstract = {We have systematically optimized the concentrations of 20 components
	of a previously published serumfree medium (Brewer and Cotman, Brain
	Res 494: 65-74, 1989) for survival of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons
	after 4 days in culture. This serum-freemedium Supplement, B27, produced
	neuron survival above 60% independent of plating density above 160
	plated cells/mm2 For isolated cells (&lt;100 cells/mm2), survival
	at 4 days was still above 45%, but could be rescued to the 60% level
	at 40 cells/mm2 by simply applying a coverslip on top of the cells.
	This suggests a need for additional trophic factors. High survival
	was achieved with osmolarity lower than found in Dulbecco's Modified
	Eagle's Medium (DMEM), and by reducing cysteine and glutamine concentrations
	and by the elimination of toxic ferrnous sulphate found in DME/F12.
	Neurobasal is a new medium that incorporates these modifications
	to DMEM. In B27/ Neurobasal, glial growth is reduced to less than
	0.5% of the nearly pure neuronal population, as judged by immunocytochemistry
	for glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuron-specific enolase.
	Excellent long-term viability is achieved after 4 weeks in culture
	with greater than 90%viability for cells plated at 640/mm2 and greater
	than 50 viability for cells plated at 160/mm2 Since the medium also
	supports the growth of neurons from embryonic rat striatum, substantia
	nigra, septum, and cortex, and neonatal dentate gyrus and cerebellum
	(Brewer, in preparation), support for other neuron types is likely.
	B27/Neurobasal should be useful for in vitro studies of neuronal
	toxicology, pharmacology, electrophysiology, gene expression, development,
	and effects of growth factors and hormones. {\copyright} 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Surface chemistries that prevent protein adsorption and
	render surfaces nonadhesive have emerged as promising biomaterial
	modifications for minimizing host-implant inflammatory responses
	and providing a nonspecific background for the presentation of bioactive
	motifs to elicit directed cellular responses. Oligo(ethylene glycol)
	moieties (-(CH2CH2O)n-, abbreviated as EGn) have proven to be the
	most protein-resistant functionality and remain the standard for
	comparison. In the present study, we analyzed fibronectin (FN) adsorption
	and cell adhesion to CH3/EG3 mixed self-assembled monolayers. In
	contrast to previous studies with ellipsometry and surface plasmon
	resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate significant radiolabeled FN
	adsorption onto EG3-containing surfaces, including pure EG3 monolayers.
	These FN-coated surfaces supported FN density-dependent increases
	in fibroblast adhesion strength. However, while FN adsorbed irreversibly
	to CH3-terminated surfaces, adsorbed FN was removed from EG3 monolayers
	and the corresponding cell adhesion eliminated by long-term (16 h)
	incubation in either protein-free or serum-containing solutions.
	Once the adsorbed FN was eluted, EG3 monolayers remained nonadhesive,
	even in the presence of serum-containing media. These results provide
	new insights into the interactions between cells and synthetic, nonadhesive
	surfaces.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we explore and model the behavior of a prototype microfluidic
	device which employs two non-mixing fluids (sheath and inlet fluids)
	displaying an asymmetric focused flow, in the presence of a fluorescent
	dye. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is employed, allowing
	the precise measure of flow speeds across the channels and of the
	concentration profile of the central focused flux along the flow
	direction. The system is modeled via a standard Navier-Stokes finite-element
	approach, coupled to convection-diffusion equations for the solute.
	Simulations reproduce accurately the shape, the position, and the
	width of the velocity and concentration profiles along the central
	channel and across the transversal and vertical sections of the microfluidic
	device. The observed asymmetric flow with respect to the center of
	the channel is reproduced numerically with an error in the position
	determination smaller than 1%.},

@article{Esch2011,
	Abstract = {High-quality, in vitro screening tools are essential in identifying
	promising compounds during drug development. Tests with currently
	used cell-based assays provide an indication of a compound's potential
	therapeutic benefits to the target tissue, but not to the whole body.
	Data obtained with animal models often cannot be extrapolated to
	humans. Multicompartment microfluidic-based devices, particularly
	those that are physical representations of physiologically based
	pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, may contribute to improving the drug
	development process. These scaled-down devices, termed micro cell
	culture analogs (μCCAs) or body-on-a-chip devices, can simulate multitissue
	interactions under near-physiological fluid flow conditions and with
	realistic tissue-to-tissue size ratios. Because the device can be
	used with both animal and human cells, it can facilitate crossspecies
	extrapolation. Used in conjunction with PBPK models, the devices
	permit an estimation of effective concentrations that can be used
	for studies with animal models or predict the human response. The
	devices also provide a means for relatively high-throughput screening
	of drug combinations and, when utilized with a patient's tissue sample,
	an opportunity for individualized medicine. Here we review effortsmade
	toward the development ofmicrofabricated cell culture systems and
	give examples that demonstrate their potential use in drug development,
	such as identifying synergistic drug interactions as well as simulating
	multiorgan metabolic interactions. In addition to their use in drug
	development, the devices also can be used to estimate the toxicity
	of chemicals as occupational hazards and environmental contaminants.},

@article{Garcia1998,
	Abstract = {Binding of integrin receptors to extracellular ligands is a complex
	process involving receptor-ligand interactions at the cell-substrate
	interface, signals activating the receptors, and assembly of cytoskeletal
	and adhesion plaque proteins at the cytoplasmic face. To analyze
	the contribution of these elements to overall cell adhesion, we have
	developed a model system that characterizes the functional binding
	characteristic for adhesion receptors as the force required to separate
	the integrin-ligand bond. A spinning disk device was used to apply
	a range of controlled hydrodynamic forces to adherent cells. The
	adhesion of K562 erythroleukemia cells, a cell line expressing a
	single fibronectin receptor, integrin [alpha]5[beta]1, which was
	uniformly activated with the monoclonal antibody TS2/16, to defined
	fibronectin surface densities was examined. Cell adhesion strength
	increased linearly with receptor and ligand densities. Based on chemical
	equilibrium principles, it is shown that adhesion strength is directly
	proportional to the number of receptor-ligand bonds. This analysis
	provides for the definition of a new physical parameter, the adhesion
	constant [psi], which is related to the bond strength and binding
	equilibrium constant and has units of force-length2. This parameter
	can be measured by the experimental system presented and is governed
	by the activation state of integrin receptors. This simplified model
	isolates the integrin receptor-ligand binding parameters and provides
	a basis for analysis of the functions of signaling and cytoskeletal
	elements in the adhesion process.},

	Abstract = {A review on microstructured mixer devices and their mixing principles
	concerning miscible liquids (and gases) is given. This is supplemented
	by the description of typical mixing element designs, methods for
	mixing characterisation, and application fields. The mixing principles
	applied can be divided in two classes relying either on the pumping
	energy or provision of other external energy to achieve mixing, termed
	passive and active mixing, respectively. As far as passive mixing
	is concerned, devices and techniques such as Y- and T-type flow-,
	multi-laminating-, split-and-recombine-, chaotic-, jet colliding-,
	recirculation flow-mixers and others are discussed. Active mixing
	can be accomplished by time-pulsing flow owing to a periodical change
	of pumping energy or electrical fields, acoustic fluid shaking, ultrasound,
	electrowetting-based droplet shaking, microstirrers, and others.},

@article{Keselowsky2003,
	Abstract = {Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to proteins adsorbed onto synthetic
	surfaces anchors cells and triggers signals that direct cell function.
	In the case of fibronectin (Fn), adsorption onto substrates of varying
	properties alters its conformation/structure and its ability to support
	cell adhesion. In the present study, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
	of alkanethiols on gold were used as model surfaces to investigate
	the effects of surface chemistry on Fn adsorption, integrin binding,
	and cell adhesion. SAMs presenting terminal CH3, OH, COOH, and NH2
	functionalities modulated adsorbed Fn conformation as determined
	through differences in the binding affinities of monoclonal antibodies
	raised against the central cell-binding domain (OH &gt; COOH = NH2
	&gt; CH3). Binding of alpha5beta1 integrin to adsorbed Fn was controlled
	by SAM surface chemistry in a manner consistent with antibody binding
	(OH &gt; COOH = NH2 &gt; CH3), whereas alphaV integrin binding followed
	the trend: COOH &gt;&gt; OH = NH2 = CH3, demonstrating alpha5beta1
	integrin specificity for Fn adsorbed onto the NH2 and OH SAMs. Cell
	adhesion strength to Fn-coated SAMs correlated with alpha5beta1 integrin
	binding (OH &gt; COOH = NH2 &gt; CH3), and experiments with function-perturbing
	antibodies demonstrated that this receptor provides the dominant
	adhesion mechanism in this cell model. This work establishes an experimental
	framework to analyze adhesive mechanisms controlling cell-surface
	interactions and provides a general strategy of surface-directed
	control of adsorbed protein activity to manipulate cell function
	in biomaterial and biotechnological applications. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals,

	effects of surface chemistry on myoblast proliferation and differentiation.
	Surfaces were pre-coated with equivalent densities of fibronectin.
	C2C12 skeletal myoblasts exhibited surface-dependent differences
	in cell proliferation (COOH=NH2>CH3=OH). Myogenin and troponin T
	gene expression levels were up-regulated on CH3 and OH surfaces compared
	to other chemistries. Furthermore, immunostaining for sarcomeric
	myosin revealed surface chemistry-dependent differences in myogenic
	differentiation following the pattern OH>CH3>NH2=COOH. Immunostaining
	analyses of integrin subunits demonstrated surface chemistry-dependent
	differences in integrin binding to adsorbed fibronectin. OH and CH3
	surfaces supported selective binding of [alpha]5[beta]1 integrin
	while the COOH and NH2 functionalities displayed binding of both
	[alpha]5[beta]1 and [alpha]V[beta]3[dot operator] Myogenic differentiation

@article{McGrath2003,
	Abstract = {Skeletal muscle LIM protein 1 (SLIM1/FHL1) contains four and a half
	LIM domains and is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
	Elevated SLIM1 mRNA expression has been associated with postnatal
	skeletal muscle growth and stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy in
	mice. Conversely, SLIM1 mRNA levels decrease during muscle atrophy.
	Together, these observations suggest a link between skeletal muscle
	growth and increased SLIM1 expression. However, the precise function
	of SLIM1 in skeletal muscle, specifically the role of SLIM1 during
	skeletal muscle differentiation, is not known. This study investigated
	the effect of increased SLIM1 expression during skeletal muscle differentiation.
	Western blot analysis showed an initial decrease followed by an increase
	in SLIM1 expression during differentiation. Overexpression of SLIM1
	in Sol8 or C2C12 skeletal muscle cell lines, at levels observed during
	hypertrophy, induced distinct effects in differentiating myocytes
	and undifferentiated reserve cells, which were distinguished by differential
	staining for two markers of differentiation, MyoD and myogenin. In
	differentiating skeletal myocytes, SLIM1 overexpression induced hyperelongation,
	which, by either plating cells on poly-L-lysine or using a series
	of peptide blockade experiments, was shown to be specifically dependent
	on ligand binding to the {alpha}5{beta}1-integrin, whereas in reserve
	cells, SLIM1 overexpression induced the formation of multiple cytoplasmic
	protrusions (branching), which was also integrin mediated. These
	results suggest that SLIM1 may play an important role during the
	early stages of skeletal muscle differentiation, specifically in
	{alpha}5{beta}1-integrin-mediated signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Protein adsorption onto synthetic materials influences cell
	adhesion and signaling events that direct cell function in numerous
	biomedical applications. Adsorption of fibronectin (FN) to different
	surfaces alters protein structure and modulates 51 integrin binding,
	cell adhesion, cell spreading, and cell migration. In the present
	study, self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols on Au were used
	to analyze the effects of surface chemistry (CH3, OH, NH2, and COOH)
	on the adsorption of a recombinant fragment of FN, FNIII7-10, that
	incorporates both the synergy and RGD cell binding motifs. Surface
	chemistry potentiated differential FNIII7-10 adsorption kinetics
	and adsorbed structure as determined by surface plasmon resonance
	spectroscopy and antibody binding assays. FNIII7-10 functional activity,
	determined by cell adhesion strength, was modulated in a fashion
	consistent with these structural changes (OH = NH2 > COOH > CH3).
	However, these changes in protein parameters did not correlate simply
	to differences in surface hydrophobicity, indicating that additional
	surface parameters influence protein adsorption. These results demonstrate
	that surface chemistry modulates adsorbed protein structure and activity
	and establish a relationship between surface-dependent changes in
	structural domains of FNIII7-10 and functional activity.},

	Abstract = {We have developed an in vitro system that combines the use of a defined
	medium with a chemically defined surface for the differentiation
	of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons. Cells were grown on silica
	substrates modified with two chemically distinct molecules: poly--lysine
	and an amine-containing organosilane. Cells were dissociated by mechanical
	or enzymatic methods and grown in serum-containing versus serum-free
	medium on these surfaces. Our results demonstrate that optimal survival
	and growth in serum-free medium occurs on the artificial surfaces.
	X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surfaces
	both before and after cell culture. In addition, surface properties
	such as elemental composition, the initial thickness of the substrate
	material, and the thickness of material deposited during the course
	of cell culture were quantified after cell removal. Taken together,
	the results from the cell culture and surface analysis demonstrate
	that the media, proteins deposited from the media onto the surface,
	surface composition, and properties intrinsic to neuronal membranes
	all interact in a complex fashion to determine whether or not the
	cells will adhere and survive in culture. In particular, the role
	of material deposited from the medium onto the culture substratum
	may be more important than has been previously appreciated. This
	system allows for the study of neuronal differentiation in a well-defined
	environment.},

	shown to express axonal markers. Cells on either the fluorinated

	Abstract = {We have studied the modulation of hippocampal neuron morphological
	development in vitro using surfaces derivatized with aminosilane
	self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The efficacies of model SAMs, alone,
	or in combination with adsorbed heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan
	(HS), are related to the physical and chemical properties of the
	surfaces. These properties are determined using X-ray photoelectron
	spectroscopy (XPS), optical ellipsometry, and wettability measurements.
	The ability of surfaces to promote somal adhesion and the maintenance
	of discrete neurites appears to be sensitive to the density and accessibility
	of positively charged amine or amide groups, and has less of an apparent
	relationship to the surface density of uncharged amines. Aromatic
	ring-containing aminosilanes are ineffective in promoting neuron
	growth, while adsorbed HS augments the neurite-promoting capacity
	of one marginally adhesive SAM. These results are relevant to an
	improved understanding of the [`]non-specific' contributions of the

	that can test the dynamics of drug effects in a more systematic way

	highlight the contribution of microscale systems towards this goal.

	A virus particles. Binding of single virions is observed from discrete
	changes in the resonance frequency/wavelength of a whispering-gallery
	mode excited in a microspherical cavity. We find that the magnitude
	of the discrete wavelength-shift signal can be sufficiently enhanced
	by reducing the microsphere size. A reactive sensing mechanism with
	inverse dependence on mode volume is confirmed in experiments with
	virus-sized polystyrene nanoparticles. By comparing the electromagnetic

	(≈5.2 × 10−16 g) of a bound virion are determined directly from the

	Abstract = {Glucose oxidase is a flavin-dependent enzyme which catalyses the oxidation
	of [beta]-d-glucose by molecular oxygen to [delta]-gluconolactone
	and hydrogen peroxide. The structure of the enzyme from Aspergillus
	niger, previously refined at 2.3 A resolution, has been refined at
	1.9 A resolution to an R value of 19.0%, and the structure of the
	enzyme from Penicillium amagasakiense, which has 65% sequence identity,
	has been determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.8 A
	resolution to an R value of 16.4%. The structures of the partially
	deglycosylated enzymes have an r.m.s. deviation of 0.7 A for main-chain
	atoms and show four N-glycosylation sites, with an extended carbohydrate
	moiety at Asn89. Substrate complexes of the enzyme from A. niger
	were modelled by force-field methods. The resulting model is consistent
	with results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments and shows
	the [beta]-d-glucose molecule in the active site of glucose oxidase,
	stabilized by 12 hydrogen bonds and by hydrophobic contacts to three
	neighbouring aromatic residues and to flavin adenine dinucleotide.
	Other hexoses, such as [alpha]-d-glucose, mannose and galactose,
	which are poor substrates for the enzyme, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose,
	form either fewer bonds or unfavourable contacts with neighbouring
	amino acids. Simulation of the complex between the reduced enzyme
	and the product, [delta]-gluconolactone, has provided an explanation
	for the lack of product inhibition by the lactone.},

	a series of 254 μm × 254 μm microchannels for transporting human
	whole blood and reagents in and out of an 8--9 μL dual-purpose (cell
	isolation and PCR) glass-silicon microchip. White blood cells were
	first isolated from a small volume of human whole blood (<3 μL) in
	an integrated cell isolation--PCR microchip containing a series of
	3.5-μm feature-sized ``weir-type'' filters, formed by an etched silicon
	dam spanning the flow chamber. A genomic target, a region in the

	amplified by microchip-based PCR on DNA released from white blood
	cells isolated on the filter section of the microchip mounted onto
