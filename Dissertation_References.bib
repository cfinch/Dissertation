	proliferated until a maximum density was reached. Similarly, adult
	neurons can be cultured that fire action potentials and display immunoreactivity
	for neurofilament, MAP2, tau, and glutamate. Seventy percent of the
	3000 isolated adult cells per milligram of brain tissue began to
	proliferate after 3 days in culture and incorporated BrdU. By 4 days
	of regeneration in culture, virtually all neuron-like cells with
	asymmetric processes were glutamate positive and immunoreactive for
	neurofilament. Immunoreactivity of the intermediate filament stem
	cell marker nestin increased in adult cells to levels present in
	freshly isolated embryonic neurons. These are the first studies to

  abstract = {Two fundamental questions about neuron cell culture were addressed.
	Can one serum-free medium that was developed for optimum growth of
	hippocampal neurons support the growth of neurons from other regions
	of the brain? Is the region specific state of differentiation maintained
	in culture? To answer these questions, we isolated neurons from six
	other rat brain regions, placed them in culture in B27/NeurobasalTM
	defined medium, and analyzed their morphology and growth dependence
	on cell density after 4 days in culture. Neuronal identity was confirmed
	by immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament 200. Neurons from
	each brain region maintained distinctive morphologies in culture
	in the virtual absence of glia. Cells isolated from embryonic day
	18 cerebral cortex by digestion with papain showed the same high
	survival as hippocampal neurons, e.g., 70% survival for cells plated
	at 160/mm2. At this age and density, neurons from the septum showed
	slightly lower survival, 45%. Survival of dentate granule neurons
	from postnatal day four brains was 30-40%, significantly lower, and
	relatively independent of plating density. This suggests an absence
	of dependence on trophic factors or contact for dentate granule neurons.
	Growth of cerebellar granule neurons isolated from postnatal day
	7, 8, or 9 brains in B27/Neurobasal was compared to growth in BME/10%
	serum. Viability in serum-free medium at 4 days was much better than
	that in serum, did not require KCI elevated to 25 mM, and occurred
	without substantial growth of glia. Cerebellar granule neurons plated
	at 1,280 cells/mm2 were maintained in culture for three weeks with
	17 of the original cell density surviving. Survival of cells isolated
	from embryonic day 18 substantia nigra was 50% at 160 cells/mm2 after
	4 days, similar to that of striatum, but slightly less than hippocampal
	neuron survival. The dopaminergic phenotype of the substantia nigral
	neurons was maintained over 2 weeks in culture as judged by immunoreactivity
	with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase. During this time, immunoreactivity
	was found in the processes as they grew out from the soma. Together,
	these studies suggest that B27/Neurobasal will be a useful medium
	for maintaining the differentiated growth of neurons from many brain
	regions. Potential applications of a common growth medium for different
	neurons are discussed. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {We have systematically optimized the concentrations of 20 components
	of a previously published serumfree medium (Brewer and Cotman, Brain
	Res 494: 65-74, 1989) for survival of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons
	after 4 days in culture. This serum-freemedium Supplement, B27, produced
	neuron survival above 60% independent of plating density above 160
	plated cells/mm2 For isolated cells (&lt;100 cells/mm2), survival
	at 4 days was still above 45%, but could be rescued to the 60% level
	at 40 cells/mm2 by simply applying a coverslip on top of the cells.
	This suggests a need for additional trophic factors. High survival
	was achieved with osmolarity lower than found in Dulbecco's Modified
	Eagle's Medium (DMEM), and by reducing cysteine and glutamine concentrations
	and by the elimination of toxic ferrnous sulphate found in DME/F12.
	Neurobasal is a new medium that incorporates these modifications
	to DMEM. In B27/ Neurobasal, glial growth is reduced to less than
	0.5% of the nearly pure neuronal population, as judged by immunocytochemistry
	for glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuron-specific enolase.
	Excellent long-term viability is achieved after 4 weeks in culture
	with greater than 90%viability for cells plated at 640/mm2 and greater
	than 50 viability for cells plated at 160/mm2 Since the medium also
	supports the growth of neurons from embryonic rat striatum, substantia
	nigra, septum, and cortex, and neonatal dentate gyrus and cerebellum
	(Brewer, in preparation), support for other neuron types is likely.
	B27/Neurobasal should be useful for in vitro studies of neuronal
	toxicology, pharmacology, electrophysiology, gene expression, development,
	and effects of growth factors and hormones. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	contrast to previous studies with ellipsometry and surface plasmon
	resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate significant radiolabeled FN
	adsorption onto EG3-containing surfaces, including pure EG3 monolayers.
	These FN-coated surfaces supported FN density-dependent increases
	in fibroblast adhesion strength. However, while FN adsorbed irreversibly
	to CH3-terminated surfaces, adsorbed FN was removed from EG3 monolayers
	and the corresponding cell adhesion eliminated by long-term (16 h)
	incubation in either protein-free or serum-containing solutions.
	Once the adsorbed FN was eluted, EG3 monolayers remained nonadhesive,
	even in the presence of serum-containing media. These results provide
	new insights into the interactions between cells and synthetic, nonadhesive

	promising compounds during drug development. Tests with currently
	used cell-based assays provide an indication of a compound’s potential
	therapeutic benefits to the target tissue, but not to the whole body.
	Data obtained with animal models often cannot be extrapolated to
	humans. Multicompartment microfluidic-based devices, particularly
	those that are physical representations of physiologically based
	pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, may contribute to improving the drug
	development process. These scaled-down devices, termed micro cell
	culture analogs (μCCAs) or body-on-a-chip devices, can simulate multitissue
	interactions under near-physiological fluid flow conditions and with
	realistic tissue-to-tissue size ratios. Because the device can be
	used with both animal and human cells, it can facilitate crossspecies
	extrapolation. Used in conjunction with PBPK models, the devices
	permit an estimation of effective concentrations that can be used
	for studies with animal models or predict the human response. The
	devices also provide a means for relatively high-throughput screening
	of drug combinations and, when utilized with a patient’s tissue sample,
	an opportunity for individualized medicine. Here we review effortsmade
	toward the development ofmicrofabricated cell culture systems and
	give examples that demonstrate their potential use in drug development,
	such as identifying synergistic drug interactions as well as simulating
	multiorgan metabolic interactions. In addition to their use in drug
	development, the devices also can be used to estimate the toxicity
	of chemicals as occupational hazards and environmental contaminants.},

	process involving receptor-ligand interactions at the cell-substrate
	interface, signals activating the receptors, and assembly of cytoskeletal
	and adhesion plaque proteins at the cytoplasmic face. To analyze
	the contribution of these elements to overall cell adhesion, we have
	developed a model system that characterizes the functional binding
	characteristic for adhesion receptors as the force required to separate
	the integrin-ligand bond. A spinning disk device was used to apply
	a range of controlled hydrodynamic forces to adherent cells. The
	adhesion of K562 erythroleukemia cells, a cell line expressing a
	single fibronectin receptor, integrin [alpha]5[beta]1, which was
	uniformly activated with the monoclonal antibody TS2/16, to defined
	fibronectin surface densities was examined. Cell adhesion strength
	increased linearly with receptor and ligand densities. Based on chemical
	equilibrium principles, it is shown that adhesion strength is directly
	proportional to the number of receptor-ligand bonds. This analysis
	provides for the definition of a new physical parameter, the adhesion
	constant [psi], which is related to the bond strength and binding
	equilibrium constant and has units of force-length2. This parameter
	can be measured by the experimental system presented and is governed
	by the activation state of integrin receptors. This simplified model
	isolates the integrin receptor-ligand binding parameters and provides
	a basis for analysis of the functions of signaling and cytoskeletal
	elements in the adhesion process.},

  abstract = {Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to proteins adsorbed onto synthetic
	surfaces anchors cells and triggers signals that direct cell function.
	In the case of fibronectin (Fn), adsorption onto substrates of varying
	properties alters its conformation/structure and its ability to support
	cell adhesion. In the present study, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
	of alkanethiols on gold were used as model surfaces to investigate
	the effects of surface chemistry on Fn adsorption, integrin binding,
	and cell adhesion. SAMs presenting terminal CH3, OH, COOH, and NH2
	functionalities modulated adsorbed Fn conformation as determined
	through differences in the binding affinities of monoclonal antibodies
	raised against the central cell-binding domain (OH &gt; COOH = NH2
	&gt; CH3). Binding of alpha5beta1 integrin to adsorbed Fn was controlled
	by SAM surface chemistry in a manner consistent with antibody binding
	(OH &gt; COOH = NH2 &gt; CH3), whereas alphaV integrin binding followed
	the trend: COOH &gt;&gt; OH = NH2 = CH3, demonstrating alpha5beta1
	integrin specificity for Fn adsorbed onto the NH2 and OH SAMs. Cell
	adhesion strength to Fn-coated SAMs correlated with alpha5beta1 integrin
	binding (OH &gt; COOH = NH2 &gt; CH3), and experiments with function-perturbing

	cross-linking integrin-ligand complexes via a water-soluble homo-bifunctional
	cross-linker, extracting bulk cellular components in detergent, and
	detecting bound integrins by ELISA. Focal adhesion components (vinculin,
	talin, [alpha]-actinin) localized to adhesion plaques were isolated
	from bulk cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic components by mechanical rupture
	at a plane close to the basal cell surface and quantified by Western
	blotting. These approaches represent simple and efficient methodologies
	to analyze structure-function relationships in cell-material interactions.},

	LIM domains and is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
	Elevated SLIM1 mRNA expression has been associated with postnatal
	skeletal muscle growth and stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy in
	mice. Conversely, SLIM1 mRNA levels decrease during muscle atrophy.
	Together, these observations suggest a link between skeletal muscle
	growth and increased SLIM1 expression. However, the precise function
	of SLIM1 in skeletal muscle, specifically the role of SLIM1 during
	skeletal muscle differentiation, is not known. This study investigated
	the effect of increased SLIM1 expression during skeletal muscle differentiation.
	Western blot analysis showed an initial decrease followed by an increase
	in SLIM1 expression during differentiation. Overexpression of SLIM1
	in Sol8 or C2C12 skeletal muscle cell lines, at levels observed during
	hypertrophy, induced distinct effects in differentiating myocytes
	and undifferentiated reserve cells, which were distinguished by differential
	staining for two markers of differentiation, MyoD and myogenin. In
	differentiating skeletal myocytes, SLIM1 overexpression induced hyperelongation,
	which, by either plating cells on poly-L-lysine or using a series
	of peptide blockade experiments, was shown to be specifically dependent
	on ligand binding to the {alpha}5{beta}1-integrin, whereas in reserve
	cells, SLIM1 overexpression induced the formation of multiple cytoplasmic
	protrusions (branching), which was also integrin mediated. These
	results suggest that SLIM1 may play an important role during the
	early stages of skeletal muscle differentiation, specifically in
	{alpha}5{beta}1-integrin-mediated signaling pathways.},

	determined by cell adhesion strength, was modulated in a fashion
	consistent with these structural changes (OH = NH2 > COOH > CH3).
	However, these changes in protein parameters did not correlate simply
	to differences in surface hydrophobicity, indicating that additional

	substrates modified with two chemically distinct molecules: poly--lysine
	and an amine-containing organosilane. Cells were dissociated by mechanical
	or enzymatic methods and grown in serum-containing versus serum-free
	medium on these surfaces. Our results demonstrate that optimal survival
	and growth in serum-free medium occurs on the artificial surfaces.
	X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surfaces
	both before and after cell culture. In addition, surface properties
	such as elemental composition, the initial thickness of the substrate
	material, and the thickness of material deposited during the course

	that the media, proteins deposited from the media onto the surface,
	surface composition, and properties intrinsic to neuronal membranes
	all interact in a complex fashion to determine whether or not the

  abstract = {Glucose oxidase is a flavin-dependent enzyme which catalyses the oxidation
	of [beta]-d-glucose by molecular oxygen to [delta]-gluconolactone
	and hydrogen peroxide. The structure of the enzyme from Aspergillus
	niger, previously refined at 2.3 A resolution, has been refined at
	1.9 A resolution to an R value of 19.0%, and the structure of the
	enzyme from Penicillium amagasakiense, which has 65% sequence identity,
	has been determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.8 A
	resolution to an R value of 16.4%. The structures of the partially
	deglycosylated enzymes have an r.m.s. deviation of 0.7 A for main-chain
	atoms and show four N-glycosylation sites, with an extended carbohydrate
	moiety at Asn89. Substrate complexes of the enzyme from A. niger
	were modelled by force-field methods. The resulting model is consistent
	with results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments and shows
	the [beta]-d-glucose molecule in the active site of glucose oxidase,
	stabilized by 12 hydrogen bonds and by hydrophobic contacts to three
	neighbouring aromatic residues and to flavin adenine dinucleotide.
	Other hexoses, such as [alpha]-d-glucose, mannose and galactose,
	which are poor substrates for the enzyme, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose,
	form either fewer bonds or unfavourable contacts with neighbouring
	amino acids. Simulation of the complex between the reduced enzyme
	and the product, [delta]-gluconolactone, has provided an explanation
	for the lack of product inhibition by the lactone.},

	preparation and nucleic acid amplification reactions. The microchip
	module is comprised of a custom-made heater-cooler for thermal cycling,
	a series of 254 μm × 254 μm microchannels for transporting human
	whole blood and reagents in and out of an 8–9 μL dual-purpose (cell
	isolation and PCR) glass-silicon microchip. White blood cells were
	first isolated from a small volume of human whole blood (<3 μL) in
	an integrated cell isolation–PCR microchip containing a series of
	3.5-μm feature-sized “weir-type” filters, formed by an etched silicon
	dam spanning the flow chamber. A genomic target, a region in the
	human coagulation Factor V gene (226-bp), was subsequently directly
	amplified by microchip-based PCR on DNA released from white blood
	cells isolated on the filter section of the microchip mounted onto
	the microchip module. The microchip module provides a convenient
	means to simplify nucleic acid analyses by integrating two key steps
	in genetic testing procedures, cell isolation and PCR and promises
	to be adaptable for additional types of integrated assays.},
