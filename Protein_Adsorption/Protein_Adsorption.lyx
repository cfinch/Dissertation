MODELING THE KINETICS OF PROTEIN ADSORPTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many studies to date have focused on the adsorption of proteins to alkanethiol
 self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).
 Alkanethiol SAMs are used to functionalize noble metal surfaces (typically
 gold).
 These SAMs are convenient in that they are relatively easy to prepare,
 present highly ordered monolayers with well-defined composition, and are
 compatible with integrated electrodes and other sensor systems utilizing
 metal-coated surfaces, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors.
 In-depth discussions of alkanethiol SAMS are easily found in the literature
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Less attention, however, has been given to alkylsilane monolayers, which
 are used to funcionalize glass or silica surfaces.
 This may be because they lack the highly ordered packing formed by alkanethiol
 SAMs (resulting in less well defined surfaces), or a perceived difficulty
 in the preparation of well-characterized alkylsilane surfaces.
 This is somewhat unfortunate, as alkylsilanes represent a broad and useful
 class of compounds that are used in an increasing variety of biomedical
 and biotechnological applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alkylsilane monolayers are used to modify the surface chemistry of glass
 and silica surfaces to control the adhesion of proteins and cells.
 Laser ablation has been used to pattern alkylsilane surfaces to create
 cytophobic and cytophilic regions that direct the attachment and growth
 of cells

\begin_layout Standard
A biosensor system utilizing whispering gallery mode (WGM) technology, where
 the active sensor is typically a silica disk, ring, toroid, or sphere/spheroid,
 can provide new insights into the adsorption behavior of biomolecules onto
 alkylsilane-modified surfaces.
 Glass and silicon oxide surfaces are much more common than metal surfaces
 in cell culture applications, so silane surface modification is of greater
 practical importance than thiol surface modification for tissue engineering.
 To fully understand the behaviour of cells and tissue constructs, it is
 critical to understand the underlying processes that govern the adsorption
 of biomolecules to silica substrates and the alkylsilane coatings used
 to functionalize them.

Whispering Gallery Mode Biosensing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WGM biosensing is based on monitoring the frequency shift of an optical
 resonance excited inside a glass microsphere 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vollmer2005,Vollmer2002"

\end_inset

.
 Near-infrared light is evanescently coupled to a glass microsphere with
 a radius of 50-200 Î¼m from a tapered optical fiber, which is connected
 to a tunable distributed feedback (DFB) laser at one end and a photodetector
 at the other.
 The laser and detector are used to precisely monitor changes in the resonant
 wavelength of the microsphere.
 As proteins or other material accrete at the surface of the microsphere,
 the effective radius of the sphere increases, resulting in a red shift
 of the resonant wavelength that can be quantified and used to calculate
 the average surface density of adsorbed material.
 Even with a simple experimental configuration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vollmer2002"

\end_inset

 it has been shown that a detection limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1pg/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

 can be readily achieved.
 This is ten times more sensitive than an SPR biosensor and theoretical
 calculations predict the ultimate detection limit of the method to be close
 to the single molecule level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Armani2003,Vollmer2008,Vollmer2008a,Arnold2003"

\end_inset

.
 These qualities make WGM biosensing an ideal method for studying protein
 adsorption, as the dynamic range of the method allows measurements to be
 performed in concentration regimes that previously were unattainable.
 To date, optical resonators of this kind have been applied to a variety
 of biosensing applications with great effect.
 In addition to the inherent sensitivity of the method, standard CMOS technology
 can be applied to fabricate arrays of resonators on silicon wafers that
 provide a scalable multiplex sensing capability for detecting multiple
 biological or chemical markers from a single sample in parallel 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Furthermore it has been shown that these measurements can be performed
 in complex samples such a blood plasma and serum 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This provides an added level of complexity as

 samples such a plasma and serum contain a mixture of hundreds of proteins,
 which may non-specifically bind to a sensor giving inaccurate readings
 or false positive measurements.

Fibronectin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unique capabilities of the WGM sensor were utilized to quantify the
 kinetics of the adsorption of fibronectin (FN) onto alkylsilane surfaces.
 Cell studies were then done to evaluate the biological activity of the
 adsorbed FN

 Fibronectin is an important protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) that
 mediates the interaction of cells with surfaces, but its activity has been
 shown to be influenced by its surface structure 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lan2005,Michael2003"

\end_inset

.
 Since the adsorption of FN has been widely studied, the results from the
 WGM instrument could be compared to an extensive amount of data.
 Fibronectin (FN) is a physiologically important protein in vertebrates.
 It is abundant in plasma and other bodily fluids, and plays an important
 role in the extracellular matrix.
 The structure of fibronectin is complex.
 The primary structure of FN is a chain composed of three types of repeated
 modules.
 Although only one gene codes for FN, alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA
 results in numerous variants in which modules are added or deleted 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pankov2002"

\end_inset

.
 X-ray crystallography has been used to determine the secondary and tertiary
 structure of the three types of modules.
 The complete FN molecule has not been crystallized, so its secondary and
 tertiary structure are unknown.
 It is likely that the secondary and tertiary structure are highly dependent
 on the local environment.
 In solution, fibronectin exists as a dimer with two identical subunits
 linked by disulfide bonds.
 In the extracellular matrix, fibronectin is assembled into a fibrillar
 network

The WGM biosensor was also used to quantify the kinetics of adsorption of
 glucose oxidase (GO) onto alkylsilane surfaces.
 The activity of the adsorbed enzyme was measured to provide more information
 about its conformation on the surface.
 Glucose oxidase is an important and useful enzyme from a technological
 standpoint.
 GO which has been adsorbed or covalently attached to electrodes forms the
 basis for amperometric glucose sensors

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The glass WGM resonator was modified with alkylsilane monolayers presenting
 well-defined surface chemistries: DETA, 13F, and SiPEG.
 The WGM biosensor was then used to quantitatively study the kinetics of
 adsorption of GO and FN at varying concentrations onto SiPEG, DETA and
 13F SAMs.
 The adsorption of GO was also measured on bare glass.
 The WGM biosensor incorporated a flow cell, which minimized the effect
 of transport limitations on protein adsorption, and this, along with the
 inherent sensitivity of the method, allowed the kinetics of adsorption
 of FN to be measured at concentrations lower than those that have previously
 been reported 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michael2003"

\end_inset

.
 Quantitative results fort the kinetics of GO adsorption have not been previousl
y reported.
 The kinetic data provided additional information about the mechanism of
 adsorption that is not available from the more common equilibrium experiments.
 Kinetic models of protein adsorption were fitted to the measured kinetic
 curves, and the resulting parameters were used to assist in interpreting
 the results.
 To maximize the accuracy of the fitted kinetic parameters, computational
 fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to quantify the limitations
 in the transport of protein to the sensor surface.
 For determining the biological activity of the adsorbed FN, neuronal and
 skeletal muscle cells were cultured on the SiPEG, DETA, and 13F surfaces
 in a serum-free culture system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brewer1995,Das2007"

\end_inset

.
 The enzymatic activity of the GO was determined with a standard assay kit.
 WGM biosensing provides a unique capability to quantify protein adsorption
 on silane-modified surfaces for the purpose of understanding the interactions
 between tissues and tailored interfaces.
 Fitting kinetic models to the data from the WGM biosensor enabled new conclusio
ns to be made about the mechanisms of adsorption on alkylsilane surfaces.

 After the assembly of the flow cell, PBS solution was flowed through the

 Protein solution at the appropriate concentration was flowed through the
 system with a peristaltic pump at a volumetric flow rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $150\mu l/hr$
\end_inset

.
 LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX) was used to control the sweep
 of the laser wavelength and acquire data.
 The data acquisition software tracked the location of each resonant valley
 in the acquired spectrum using a peak fitting algorithm.
 All valleys with a FWHM (full width at half maximum) value below a certain
 threshold were tracked, and the position of each valley minimum was determined
 by fitting a Bessel function.
 The position of each resonance over time was saved to a binary file to
 be analyzed later.

Data analysis software was written using the Python programming language.
 The binary file created by LabVIEW for each experiment was loaded into
 the software and the spectral location (

.
 The acrylate coating was first removed using a fiber optic stripper and
 the stripped region was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol (iPA) to remove
 any residual acrylate.
 The end of the stripped fiber was then placed in the flame of a nitrous-butane
 Microflame torch (Azuremoon trading company, Cordova, TN).
 A nitrous-butane flame was used due to the very high temperatures needed
 to melt the glass and form the resonator (
\begin_inset Formula $>700^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

).
 The tip of the fiber was placed in the flame until the glass glowed bright
 white and began to melt.
 The surface tension of the molten glass caused it to form into a spheroidal
 droplet.
 As the tip melted, the fiber was rotated to ensure that the resonator remained
 centered on the stalk of the fiber.
 Resonator radii used for these studies ranged from

 Storing and preparing solutions in this way prevented solution phase polymeriza

Analysis of Transport in the WGM Biosensor
\end_layout

The rate of adsorption on a surface may be limited by the rate at which
 the chemistry of adsorption takes place, the rate of transport to the surface,
 or both.
 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the transport of protein
 in the flow cell of the WGM biosensor.
 CFD simulations were run with a CFD-ACE+ multiphysics solver (ESI Software,
 Huntsville, AL) to determine the influence of transport on the adsorption
 of protein on the resonator surface.
 Before beginning, a Reynolds number calculation was performed to confirm
 that flow in the device would be entirely laminar.
 For all CFD simulations, the size of the mesh and the time step were refined
 until the simulation results did not change significantly.
 Upwind differencing was used to approximate velocity derivatives, a 2nd
 order limiter was used to approximate concentration derivatives, and the

 This model did not include the resonator and waveguide, as they have a
 minimal effect on the overall flow in the channel.
 A steady-state simulation was performed first to calculate the flow field.
 Transient simulations were then performed in which the concentration at
 the inlet of the tubing was suddenly increased from zero to the target
 concentration.
 The concentration of protein was monitored at a point in the flow cell
 at the location of the resonator, and the simulation was run until the
 concentration at this point reached the target value.
 It was assumed that the low concentrations of protein used in these experiments
 did not affect the flow field significantly, so the transient simulations
 utilized the flow field from the steady-state simulation to reduce computation
 time.

Two additional CFD models were created to simulate the transport of protein

 Because the axisymmetric geometry models a channel with a circular cross
 section while the actual channel has a square cross section, the flow velocity
 at the inlet was adjusted so the velocity near the resonator matched the
 results from the three-dimensional simulation.
 Data from the simulation of the whole flow cell was used to set the concentrati
on over time at the inlet of the axisymmetric model.
 A surface reaction was defined on the surface of the resonator using the
 Langmuir model built in to the Biochemistry module of ACE+.
 The purpose of this reaction was to deplete the protein near the resonator
 at an appropriate rate, rather than to model the actual chemistry of adsorption.
 An association rate constant of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.44\times10^{6}L\, mol{}^{-1}s^{-1}$
\end_inset

, a dissociation rate constant of 
\begin_inset Formula $8.9\times10^{-4}s^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and a maximum density of adsorption sites of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.4\times10^{-9}mol\, m^{-2}$
\end_inset

 were used to match the maximum adsorption rate that was observed in the
 experimental data for FN on DETA and 13F.
 A steady-state simulation was used to establish the flow field and a transient
 simulation was used to determine the concentration of protein near the
 surface of the resonator.
 The adsorption simulation mandated a fairly small time step (on the order
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}s$
\end_inset

), so it was impractical to run the simulation to equilibrium due to the
 large number of time steps required.
 The system was simulated for 150-300 seconds (of simulated time).
 It was assumed that the near-surface concentration increased linearly from
 the end of the CFD simulation to the target concentration.

RSA-Type Model of Adsorption with Transition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Single-layer adsorption models cannot adequately predict the kinetics of
 adsorption for many combinations of proteins and surfaces.
 More complex models have been developed to account for these experimental
 results.
 Because many surfaces cause proteins to denature upon adsorption, it is
 common to model adsorption with a post-adsorption transition.
 This process can be described by the kinetic equations
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\frac{d\rho_{\alpha}}{dt} & =k_{a}c\,\Phi_{\alpha}-k_{s}\rho_{\alpha}\Psi_{\alpha\beta}-k_{d}\rho_{\alpha}\label{eq:Adsorption Transition Kinetics}\\
\frac{d\rho_{\beta}}{dt} & =k_{s}\rho_{\alpha}\Psi_{\alpha\beta}\label{eq:Adsorption Transition Kinetics 2}\end{align}

\end_inset

The form of the blocking functions depends upon the assumptions of the model.
 When the particles are spherical, scaled particle theory (SPT) can be used
 to derive the following blocking functions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Brusatori1999"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\Phi_{\alpha} & =\left(1-\theta\right)\exp\left[-\frac{2\left(\overline{\rho_{\alpha}}+\Sigma\overline{\rho_{\beta}}\right)}{1-\theta}-\frac{\overline{\rho_{\alpha}}+\overline{\rho_{\beta}}+\left(\Sigma-1\right)^{2}\overline{\rho_{\alpha}}\overline{\rho_{\beta}}}{\left(1-\theta\right)^{2}}\right]\label{eq:Phi_alpha}\\
\Psi_{\alpha\beta} & =\exp\left[-\frac{2\left(\Sigma-1\right)\left(\overline{\rho_{\alpha}}+\Sigma\overline{\rho_{\beta}}\right)}{1-\theta}-\frac{\left(\Sigma^{2}-1\right)\left[\overline{\rho_{\alpha}}+\overline{\rho_{\beta}}+\left(\Sigma-1\right)^{2}\overline{\rho_{\alpha}}\overline{\rho_{\beta}}\right]}{\left(1-\theta\right)^{2}}\right]\label{eq:Psi_alpha_beta}\end{align}

 The kinetics of adsorption can be modeled by a set of coupled ordinary
 differential equations:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\frac{d\theta_{AB}}{dt} & =k_{a1}c\,\left(\theta_{\infty}-\theta_{AB}-\theta_{AAB}\right)-k_{d1}\theta_{AB}-k_{a2}c\,\theta_{AB}\label{eq:Two Layer AB}\\

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{AB}$

\end_inset

 is the fraction of the surface covered by two layers of particles.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\theta_{AB}+\theta_{AAB}$

 the resulting formulae are complicated, and the analysis of the solutions

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calculating the Surface Density of Active GO 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the Langmuir and RSA models only allow protein to exist in one state,
 all of the adsorbed protein must be treated as active or inactive.
 For the two adsorption models that incorporate a post-adsorption transition,
 enzyme in the initial state was assumed to be active, and enzyme in the
 denatured state was assumed to be inactive.
 For the two-layer model, it was assumed that enzyme molecules in the upper
 layer prevented the substrate solution from interacting with molecules
 adsorbed in the lower layer.
 Enzyme in the lower layer was therefore treated as inactive.
 The activity of adsorbed enzyme in contact with the surface which is not
 screened by an upper layer depends upon the nature of the surface.
 It was assumed that hydrophilic surfaces (glass and DETA) did not induce
 denaturation upon adsorption, so single-layer protein was assumed to be
 active.
 The surface density of active enzyme was calculated
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{active}=\rho_{AB}+\rho_{AAB}$
\end_inset

.
 For 13F (a hydrophobic surface), it was assumed that adsorption induces
 denaturation and destroys the activity of the enzyme.
 Only enzyme in the upper layer was considered to be active, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{active}=\rho_{AAB}$
\end_inset

 The surface densities of active protein and total protein predicted by
 the models were plotted and compared to experimental results.

Each model was fitted to the experimental data from the WGM biosensor for
 glass, DETA, 13F, and SiPEG by adjusting the parameters until the best

 The concentration of protein in solution near the surface was assumed to
 be constant.
 For each surface, kinetic curves from all solution concentrations were
 fitted simultaneously with a single set of parameters using the 
\emph on
leastsq
\emph default
 fitting routine from Scipy, which uses a modified version of the Levenberg-Marq
uardt algorithm.
 Third-order splines were used to interpolate the averaged experimental
 data to the same time points used in the model.
 The quality of fit was quantified by computing the sum of squared errors
 (SSE) for the total surface concentration of adsorbed protein measured
 by the WGM sensor and the surface concentration predicted by the model.
 The SSE for each experimetn was divided by the total number of data points
 in the data set so that the quality of fit could be compared between data
 sets with different numbers of time points.

It can be seen that the flow field around the resonator was symmetric about
 the long axis of the resonator, with only a minor perturbation caused by
 the presence of the waveguide.
 This configuration ensured that the shear rate was constant in the region
 where the evanescent wave was excited, minimizing any shear rate effects
 on the adsorption of protein from solution.
 These results also confirmed that the axisymmetric model was a reasonable
 choice for simulating the depletion region near the surface of the resonator.

 the concentration near the surface of the resonator required about 150
 seconds to reach its final value.
 Figure

 indicates that the near-surface concentration takes even longer to reach
 its final value as the bulk concentration is decreased.
 Transport was not analyzed for the SiPEG surface because its low affiinity
 for protein was not expected to deplete protein in solution near the surface
 significantly.
 The surface density of adsorbed FN predicted by the CFD model is shown
 in Figure

 The results for DETA and 13F are virtually identical.
 To verify that the correct kinetic constants were used in Langmuir adsorption
 model, the surface density of adsorbed protein over time predicted by the
 CFD simulations was plotted along with the measured surface density.
 These results are shown in Figure .

\begin_layout Subsection
Modeling the Adsorption of Glucose Oxidase on Silane Surfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimentally measured kinetic curves for glucose oxidase on glass,
 DETA, 13F, and SiPEG, along with the model that achieved the best fit to
 each data set, are shown in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GO glass plot"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GO on 13F"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GO on PEG"

\end_inset

, respectively.
 The initial rate of adsorption was highest on the DETA and 13F surfaces
 and lowest on the SiPEG surface.
 The surface density of adsorbed protein reached the highest saturation
 value on the DETA surface at 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, while the highest saturation at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 occurred on 13F.
 On the 13F surface the saturation surface density at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 was nearly as high as 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 Adsorption on the glass surface showed an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overshoot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 profile in which the surface density reached a maximum and then decreased
 gradually with time.
 The parameter values for the five models fitted to the experimental measurement
s are shown in Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GO params glass"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GO params DETA"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GO params 13F"

\end_inset

, respectively.
 Only the RSA and Langmuir models were fitted to GO on SiPEG, and the fitted
 parameter values are shown in Table

For GO on glass, the Langmuir-derived models fitted the data slightly better
 than the RSA-derived models.
 The Langmuir-type model with post-adsorption transition provided the best
 fit to the kinetic data.
 Both models with post-adsorption transition predicted the amount of active
 protein at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, but not at 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GO glass activity"

\end_inset

.
 The activity predicted by both models at 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 matched the experimental value much more closely if it was assumed that
 the protein was active in both the initial and final states.
 For GO on DETA, the RSA-derived models fitted the data better than the
 Langmuir-type models.
 The best fit to the kinetic curves was achieved by the RSA-type model with
 post-adsorption transition.
 However, this model did not predict the amount of active enzyme at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 The two-layer model does not fit the kinetic data quite as well, but it
 does predict the amount of active enzyme very well.
 For GO on 13F, the two-layer model and the Langmuir-type model with post-adsorp
tion transition fitted the kinetic data well.
 Although the two-layer model fitted the kinetic data slightly better, Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GO 13F activity"

 indicates that it does not accurately predict the amount of active adsorbed
 protein.
 The Langmuir-type model with a post-adsorption transition predicted the
 amount of active protein very well.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two different kinetic models have been proposed in the literature to model
 the adsorption of protein with a post-adsorption transition.
 The model by Brusatori and Van Tassel 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Brusatori1999"

\end_inset

 is analagous to the RSA model for adsorbing disks because it was assumed
 that the particles were circular before and after the transition.
 Ideally, the blocking function used in this model (equations
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Phi_alpha"

\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Psi_alpha_beta"

\end_inset

) should produce the same results as the RSA blocking function (equation
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RSA Blocking Function"

\end_inset

) when the radius of particles in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is identical to the radius of particles in state
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Blocking function comparison"

\end_inset

 demonstrates that there is a small difference between the blocking functions.
 This difference is probably because neither blocking function is exact;
 the equation for the RSA blocking function is fitted to simulation data
 and the two-stage blocking function is also an approximation.
 If the RSA model and the transition model are fitted to the same data set,
 the fitted parameters will not be identical, even if the transition rate
 constant is very small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the model used by Michael et.
 al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Michael2003"

\end_inset

 was written in terms of a different set of variables, it was revealed that
 the model uses a Langmuir-like blocking function.
 This result shows that the relationship between the kinetic models stated
 and Michael et.
 al.
 and Brusatori and Van Tassel is analogous to the relationship between the
 RSA model and the Langmuir model.
 This is illustrated in Figure

\begin_layout Subsection
Transport Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CFD simulations showed that near-surface concentration of fibronectin was
 influenced by transport limitations early in the adsorption process on
 DETA and 13F surfaces.
 Initially, transport was limited by the large amount of buffer that had
 to be displaced from the flow system before the protein solution could
 reach the resonator at full concentration.
 This limitation was due to the prototype nature of the system, and can
 be easily eliminated in future systems.
 The rate of adsorption onto the resonator was high enough to deplete the
 fibronectin in the boundary layer near the resonator.
 Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the surface and the absence
 of turbulent mixing, diffusion is the only way that fibronectin can be
 transported to the surface to adsorb.
 Fibronectin is a relatively large protein with a correspondingly low diffusion
 coefficient, so its rate of diffusive transport is rather low.
 The near-surface concentation was used instead of assuming a constant concentra
tion when fitting adsorption models to the fibronectin data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the flow cell was designed to minimize transport limitations, CFD
 analysis indicated that transport had some influence on the rate of adsorption
 of FN on DETA and 13F surfaces.
 After the protein solution in the channel reached its target concentration,
 transport was limited by the rate of diffusion across a depletion layer
 that formed at the surface of the resonator.
 This type of limitation is virtually unavoidable in microfluidic systems
 when the rate of adsorption is high and the solution concentration is low.
 Using the near-surface concentration predicted by CFD 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the experiments reported here, transport limitation had much less influence
 on the adsorption of glucose oxidase.
 GO is a smaller protein than FN, its initial rate of adsorption is lower
 and the concentrations used in these experiments were higher than the concentra
tions of FN.
 GO reached 99% of full concentration at the resonator surface within 20
 seconds, so the near-surface depletion had minimal impact on the kinetics.
 Constant concentration was assumed when fitting the kinetic adsorption
 models to the GO data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our modeling method was approximate in that the evolution of the near-surface
 concentration over time was computed once, based on the estimated adsorption
 rate, and was not modified during the curve-fitting procedure.
 A more accurate method would be to incorporate the CFD model into the fitting
 routine so that the near-surface concentration would be updated as the
 adsorption rate changed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jenkins2004"

\end_inset

.
 However, this method is only practical when the CFD simulation is simple
 enough to run very quickly.
 It was also assumed that the near-surface concentration increased linearly
 from sixty seconds until the target concentration was reached.
 Although this probably had a slight impact on the modeled kinetics, it
 was better than assuming that the concentration near the resonator remained
 constant.

Saturation surface density of adsorbed fibronectin (

The saturation surface concentration of FN, as measured by the WGM system,
 was compared to previously published results for solution concentrations
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 as shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:FN saturation values"

\end_inset

.
 The WGM measurements compare favorably with previously published results
 for a solution concentration of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 Although different measurement techniques and surface preparations were
 used, the surface concentrations on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces
 were fairly similar among the various references (reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lee2006"

\end_inset

 being the only exception).
 The saturation surface concentration of FN on hydrophilic neutral surfaces
 measured by the WGM sensor also indicated excellent agreement with previously
 published results.
 However, the amount of adsorbed protein measured by the WGM system at lower
 concentrations was significantly greater than the amount reported in previously
 published results for hydrophobic and hydrophilic charged surfaces.
 In contrast, the surface concentration value for a neutral hydrophobic
 surface was in good agreement with previous results.
 The discrepancy between the WGM sensor results and the other methods at
 low concentrations may be explained by differences in the measurement system,
 the surface chemistry, or the adsorption process.
 Since the limiting surface coverages measured by the WGM sensor agree well
 with other techniques for 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 and for neutral hydrophilic surfaces at 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, the results from the WGM sensor can be considered reliable.
 It is likely that if systematic errors were inherent to the WGM method,
 those errors would be reflected throughout all solution concentrations
 measured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible interpretation of the higher saturation values measured at
 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 and lower on 13F and DETA could be the relative packing order of silane
 monolayers compared to alkanethiol monolayers.
 Alkanethiol SAMs are known to create highly ordered monolayers due to their
 tight packing on highly ordered gold films 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Prime1991"

\end_inset

.
 Because of this tight packing only the terminal functional groups of the
 alkanethiol are presented at the surface, resulting in highly defined surface
 chemistries.
 Alkylsilane monolayers, which are formed on silica surfaces, are less tightly
 packed and therefore form less ordered monolayers, which can potentially
 present more than just the terminal functional group.
 It has been hypothesized that this may result from interaction of electron
 donating groups of the silane side chain with silanol groups at the surface
 resulting in reaction site-limited substrates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Stenger1992"

\end_inset

.
 This can lead to incomplete monolayers that allow interaction of protein
 with the unreacted substrate or allow sufficient degrees of freedom for
 the silane side-chains to adopt multiple conformations, creating less ordered
 monolayers that can rearrange to accommodate the native protein structure.
 At the high concentrations the amount of protein available to bind would
 swamp out these effects but they would be present at the lower concentrations.
 This could explain why the differences between the silane chemistry used
 in this work and the alkanethiol chemistry used in previous work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keselowsky2003"

\end_inset

 did not show up at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, this additional degree of freedom would allow the long side chains
 to rearrange to accommodate greater protein interaction for structural
 stabilization and higher coverage or to expose new surface sites for increased
 protein adsorption.
 This would not be possible with the tightly packed alkane thiol monolayers.
 This effect could also have major consequences for protein function, as
 described later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another significant difference between the WGM measurement system and previous
 work was that the protein was deposited on the WGM resonator under flow
 conditions and the measurement was continued until saturation was reached,
 while previous measurements were made after exposure to a static FN solution
 for a fixed amount of time (30-60 minutes.) The combination of high-affinity
 surfaces and low solution concentration is conducive to transport-limited
 adsorption, which could explain the discrepancy between WGM and static
 experiments for hydrophobic and charged hydrophilic surfaces.
 In contrast, neutral hydrophilic surfaces have a much lower affinity for
 protein, so depletion of protein near the surface would be much less of
 a factor, resulting in good agreement between the WGM and static measurements.

Fibronectin on DETA and 13F
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fitted parameters of the RSA model were very similar for FN adsorption
 on DETA and 13F surfaces, reflecting the similar shapes of the experimental
 curves.
 The RSA model fitted the DETA data well, indicating that the assumptions
 of the RSA model were valid for the process of adsorption on DETA.
 This result was confirmed by the fitting results for the two-stage adsorption
 model.
 The mean squared error for the model with transition was only slightly
 lower than the error for the fitted RSA model.
 We conclude that fibronectin adsorbs on DETA with a well-defined footprint,
 which does not change significantly after adsorption.
 This result is consistent with the well-established theory that proteins
 generally experience less denaturation on a hydrophilic surface than on
 a hydrophobic surface 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Latour2005"

\end_inset

.
 The experimental results for FN on 13F showed significant deviations from
 the RSA model in the saturation region, especially at higher solution concentra
tions.
 The two-stage model allows particles to change size after adsorption, which
 significantly improved the fit of the model to the data for FN on 13F.
 The fitted values for the association constant were quite similar for DETA
 and 13F, but the transition rate constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{s}$
\end_inset

 for the 13F surface was an order of magnitude larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{s}$
\end_inset

 for the DETA surface.
 The results from the fitting process indicated that FN denatured after
 adsorption on 13F, which had been previously postulated for certain hydrophobic
 surfaces

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fibronection on SiPEG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RSA model fitted the SiPEG data well.
 The association rate constat for FN adsorption on SiPEG was lower than
 the values for DETA and 13F while the dissociation rate constant was higher,
 which is expected for a protein-resistant surface.
 This result is consistent with findings that SiPEG is an electrostatically
 neutral surface that does not exhibit coulombic attraction for proteins
 in solution.
 Surprisingly, the fitted radius of FN adsorbed on SiPEG was more than twice
 the fitted radius of FN adsorbed on DETA or 13F.
 For the two-stage model, the transition rate constant for adsorption on
 SiPEG was significantly higher than for the other surfaces.
 The fitted pre-transition radius and post-transition radius of adsorbed
 FN were also larger for SiPEG than DETA or 13F.
 The large radius predicted by the RSA model and the significant transition
 predicted by the two-stage model seemed to indicate that FN denatures after
 it adsorbs to PEG.
 This prediction was not consistent with the well-known observation that
 proteins in contact with hydrophobic surfaces tend to denature, while proteins
 in contact with hydrophilic, charged surfaces tend to retain their native
 conformations.
 However, it also may indicate that the SiPEG surface could be promoting
 the denaturation of adsorbed proteins, which could explain why it is a
 cell-resistant surface despite being hydrophilic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the SSE of the fitted two-stage model was about 30% lower than
 the SSE for the RSA model, the absolute change in SSE was relatively small,
 and may not be significant.
 It is possible that the two extra variable parameters (transition rate
 constant and post-transition radius) are redundant for the SiPEG surface,
 in which case their fitted values should not be considered significant.
 It is also possible that the radius predicted by the fitting process for
 SiPEG is an artifact caused by fitting the data with a model that is not
 well suited to the surface chemistry.
 Given the assumptions of the RSA model, surface coverage can reach saturation
 in only two ways: either the rate of desorption equals the rate of adsorption,
 or there is no space left on the surface for another protein to adsorb.
 The second case may not apply to an adsorption-resistant surface like SiPEG.
 However, combinations of parameters and that fitted the initial adsorption
 kinetics did not predict the low saturation level of protein observed in
 our experiments.
 One possible explanation is that FN adsorbed to a small number of defects
 in the SiPEG monolayer, which could explain both the rapid initial adsorption
 and the small amount of adsorbed protein when the surface is saturated.
 If this were the case, a site-limited adsorption model like the Langmuir
 model may be better for modeling adsorption on SiPEG.
 Our prototype instrument did not have the sensitivity to perform a more
 thorough study of adsorption on SiPEG at low solution concentrations.
 Future systems based on whispering gallery mode technology have the potential
 to study the adsorption of proteins on SiPEG surfaces in greater detail,
 which could lead to greater understanding as to why SiPEG resists protein
 adsorption.

Cell Growth and Survival on FN-Coated Alkylsilane Monolayers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the embryonic hippocampal neurons and myocytes showed significantly
 better survival on DETA surfaces than 13F surfaces.
 However, measurements with the WGM biosensor indicated that the amount
 of adsorbed protein measured on the 13F surfaces was comparable to that
 of DETA, indicating that the conformation of adsorbed FN, and its function,
 was just as important as the quantity of FN for cell survival.
 This is consistent with the postulate made above that the silane monolayers
 are able to rearrange to accommodate more protein and that the DETA surface,
 being charged and hydrophilic, could accommodate the functional conformation
 of the FN so little or no denaturation would occur.
 Conversely, the hydrophobic side chains of the 13F could rearrange to allow
 for the adsorption of more protein but would also promote the exposure
 of the protein's hydrophobic core, thus denaturing the protein and deactivating
 its biological activity as postulated previously for hydrophobic surfaces

\begin_layout Standard
Results from the skeletal myocyte culture provided further information about
 the bioactivity of absorbed FN.
 Skeletal myocytes are precursor cells that fuse and differentiate into
 contractile myotubes.
 This differentiation is mediated by, among other factors, the interaction
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha5\beta1$
\end_inset

 integrin receptors on the surface of the myocytes with the cell binding
 domain of the FN molecule 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michael2003"

\end_inset

.
 Without this interaction, myotubes do not form.
 The muscle cell culture on 13F indicated that while a significant number
 of cells survived, no myotubes formed.
 The number of dead cells was actually less than that of SiPEG or DETA,
 and the fact that so many cells survived on the 13F substrate indicates
 that there was enough protein adsorbed to the surface to promote adhesion.
 However, the lack of myotube formation indicates that FN adsorbed on 13F
 had reduced biological activity due to its denaturation and did not activate
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha5\beta1$
\end_inset

 integrin signaling pathways necessary for myotube differentiation.
 These proliferation and differentiation results are consistent with previously
 reported results 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michael2003"

\end_inset

.
 The lack of survival of cells on SiPEG surfaces can be attributed to the
 small amount of adsorbed FN and the possibility that the protein was also
 denatured.

 Adsorption was measured with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), although
 only the saturation values were quantified.
 The size and shape of adsorbed GO was also measured by AFM.
 It was assumed that GO in solution could be approximated by an ellipsoid

\begin_inset Formula $6-8\, nm$

 It was found that GO adsorbed to native HDMS surfaces with the major axis
 parallel to the surface, while GO adsorbed to HDMS-O and HDMS-N with the

 The maximum area occupied by an adsorbed molecule (its

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Glucose Oxidase on Glass
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Langmuir-type models fitted the kinetics of GO on glass slightly better
 than the RSA-type models, and the two-stage models fitted the data better
 than the single-stage models.
 The enzyme activity data indicated that GO adsorbed on bare glass retained
 about 25% of its activity at a solution concentration of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 When the solution concentration was increased to 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, almost all of the adsorbed enzyme remained active.
 Both of the two-stage models predicted the amount of active enzyme correctly
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, but under-predicted the amount of active enzyme at 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

 with the assumption that enzyme in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 was active and enzyme in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 was inactive.
 If it was assumed that enzyme in both states remains active, both of the
 two-stage models would accurately predict the amount of active enzyme at
 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 It has been shown that some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

soft
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 enzymes lose most of their structure and activity when adsorbed to glass,
 while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 enzymes retain their structure and function after adsorption
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 An alternative hypothesis is that an initial layer of enzyme adsorbed to
 the surface in a highly spread-out state, resulting in a very low surface
 density and low activity, followed by a second layer of adsorbed enzyme
 that retained its activity.
 This could explain the low fraction of active enzyme at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, and the high fraction of active enzyme at 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 Modeling this process would require a model that incorporated both a post-adsor
ption transition and multi-layer adsorption.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Glucose Oxidase on DETA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model fits to the kinetic data for GO on DETA were not as good as the
 fits to the kinetic data for GO on glass.
 The RSA-type model with a post-adsorption transition provided the best
 fit to the kinetic data, as determined by the sum of squared error.
 It was assumed that the DETA surface did not induce proteins to denature
 upon adsorption, and this assumption was consistent with the data from
 the enzyme activity assay at 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 When the solution concentration was increased to 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, approximately half of the adsorbed GO apparently lost its activity.
 It is unlikely that this reduction was caused by denaturation, since adsorbed
 proteins are more likely to retain their native conformation when the rate
 of adsorption is higher
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Further, the fitted parameter values for the two-stage RSA-type model were
 fairly implausible.
 The fitted transition rate constant was two orders of magnitude higher
 than the transition rate constant for the glass surface, and the surface
 area occupied by a molecule in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 was 16 times larger than a molecule in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 A more likely hypothesis for the 50% reduction in activity is that a second
 layer of adsorbed enzyme formed, preventing the substrate solution from
 reaching the lower layer of enzyme.
 The two-layer model provided the best prediction of the amount of active
 adsorbed enzyme at both concentrations, although it did not fit the kinetic
 data quite as well as the RSA-type two-stage model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Glucose Oxidase on 13F
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kinetic data for GO on 13F was fitted well by both the Langmuir-type
 model with a post-adsorption transition and the two-layer model.
 Although the SSE was slightly lower for the two-layer model, the Langmuir-type
 model provided a much better prediction of the amount of active adsorbed
 enzyme.
 The experimental data showed that almost none of the adsorbed enzyme was
 active at a solution concentration of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 When the solution concentration was increased to 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, about 75% of the adsorbed enzyme retained its activity.
 GO that adsorbs from a higher solution concentration may experience less
 denaturation because it is sterically hindered from spreading out on the
 surface by the high density of adsorbed enzyme molecules.
 Surprisingly, the fitted parameters for the Langmuir-type model with a
 post-adsorption transition indicated the area occupied by a molecule in
 the final state was not much larger than that of a molecule in the initial
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Glucose Oxidase on SiPEG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite its sensitivity, the WGM sensor was unable to detect the adsorption
 of GO on an SiPEG surface reliably at a solution concentration of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mu g/ml$
\end_inset

, GO adsorbed on the SiPEG surface, but at a relatively low surface density.
 The enzyme activity assay did not detect any significant amount of active
 enzyme for either solution concentration.
 This may be because the amount of activity was below the detection limit
 of the assay, or because the enzyme did not retain its activity on SiPEG.
 It is well known that SiPEG surfaces resist protein adsorption, but denaturatio
n on SiPEG has not been previously reported.
 Further investigation is necessary to answer this question.
 Both the RSA and Langmuir single-layer models fitted this data set well.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Utilization of the WGM sensor enables, for the first time, quantitative
 analysis of protein adsorption on silane monolayers, which are more commonly
 used as substrates for cell culture than thiol monolayers.
 The sensitivity of this bench-top setup also can be readily enhanced by
 a number of methods, such as fabricating smaller microspheres and using
 a laser with a shorter wavelength

 or coating the glass microsphere with a high-index wave-guiding layer

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fitting models to the experimental data provided additional insight about
 the process of adsorption.
 It was assumed that the kinetic constants did not vary across the limited
 concentration range in this study.
 Therefore, a single set of parameters was fitted to multiple concentrations
 for a single surface.
 Fitting more concentrations, while holding the number of parameters constant,
 increased the possibility of finding a unique combination of parameters
 that minimized the SSE.
 A model with too many parameters can have multiple parameter sets with
 equivalent optimal fits, much like an under-determined system of linear
 equations.
 Although a lower SSE could have been achieved by fitting each concentration
 individually, the likelihood of finding non-unique parameters would have
 increased.
